### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### Responsive Breakpoints Used:
- Mobile: < 768px (md breakpoint)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (md to lg)
- Desktop: > 1024px (lg+)

#### Key CSS Properties Applied:
```css
/* Touch Optimizations */
WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'
scrollSnapType: 'x mandatory'
userSelect: 'none'
WebkitUserSelect: 'none'
WebkitTapHighlightColor: 'transparent'

/* Touch Targets */
minHeight: '44px' /* iOS HIG recommendation */
minWidth: 'fit-content'
padding: '8px 12px' /* Mobile optimized */

/* Typography */
fontSize: '16px' /* Prevents iOS zoom */
lineHeight: '1.5' /* Optimal readability */
```

#### Hooks and Utilities Used:
- `useResponsive()` - Screen size detection
- `useTouch()` - Touch device detection
- `touchTargets` - Consistent touch sizing
- `mediaQueries` - Responsive breakpoints

### üì± Device-Specific Optimizations
