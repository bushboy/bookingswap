# API Route Fix Summary

## Issue
The frontend was calling a non-existent backend API endpoint:
```
Route GET /api/users/38eab3e8-a013-4030-bddb-5510b22bbc22/swaps/eligible?targetSwapId=a3b8b9dc-e08f-449d-aa30-4ca00a3a461e&limit=50 not found
```

## Root Cause
- **Frontend**: SwapApiService was calling `/users/${userId}/swaps/eligible`
- **Backend**: The actual implemented route was `/swaps/user/eligible`
- **Missing Route**: The `/users/:userId/swaps/eligible` endpoint was not configured in the backend routes

## Investigation Results

### Backend Analysis
1. **SwapController**: Has `getUserEligibleSwaps` method implemented ✅
2. **Route Configuration**: Method was not properly mapped to a route ❌
3. **Expected Route**: Documentation shows `/api/swaps/user/eligible`

### Frontend Analysis
1. **SwapApiService**: Was calling `/users/${userId}/swaps/eligible`
2. **Authentication**: Frontend was passing userId in URL instead of using authenticated user

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Route to Backend
**File**: `apps/backend/src/routes/swaps.ts`

**Added:**
```typescript
// User eligible swaps for proposal creation
router.get('/user/eligible', swapController.getUserEligibleSwaps);
```

### 2. Updated Frontend API Call
**File**: `apps/frontend/src/services/swapApiService.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
const endpoint = `/users/${userId}/swaps/eligible`;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const endpoint = `/swaps/user/eligible`;
```

## Technical Details

### Authentication Handling
- **Before**: UserId passed in URL path
- **After**: UserId obtained from authenticated user (`req.user.id`)
- **Security**: More secure as user can only access their own eligible swaps

### Route Structure
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/swaps/user/eligible`
- **Authentication**: Required (uses `authMiddleware.requireAuth()`)
- **Parameters**: Query parameters only (targetSwapId, limit, offset, etc.)

### Caching Impact
- Cache keys still use userId for proper isolation
- Frontend caching logic remains unchanged
- Backend gets userId from authenticated session

## Files Modified
1. `apps/backend/src/routes/swaps.ts` - Added missing route
2. `apps/frontend/src/services/swapApiService.ts` - Updated endpoint URL

## Result
✅ **API route now exists and is properly configured**
✅ **Frontend calls correct endpoint**
✅ **Authentication works as expected**
✅ **No breaking changes to existing functionality**

## Testing
The fix resolves the 404 "Route not found" error and allows the proposal modal to properly fetch eligible swaps for the authenticated user.

## Security Improvement
By using the authenticated user's ID from the session instead of passing it in the URL, the API is more secure and prevents users from accessing other users' eligible swaps.
