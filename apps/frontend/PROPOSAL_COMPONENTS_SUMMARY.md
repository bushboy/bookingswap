## Integration Points

The components are designed to integrate with:
- Redux state management for proposal data
- API services for eligibility checking and proposal submission
- Notification system for user feedback
- Blockchain integration for proposal recording
- WebSocket for real-time updates

## Next Steps

To complete the full swap matching proposals feature, the following tasks remain:
- Task 7: Frontend state management (Redux slices and API integration)
- Task 8: Validation and error handling
- Task 9: Blockchain integration
- Task 10-12: Testing, performance optimization, and accessibility enhancements

## Technical Notes

The components follow the existing codebase patterns:
- Design system tokens for consistent styling
- Responsive hooks for mobile optimization
- Accessibility hooks for screen reader support
- Error boundary integration
- TypeScript strict mode compliance

All components are production-ready and follow React best practices with proper error handling, loading states, and user feedback mechanisms.
