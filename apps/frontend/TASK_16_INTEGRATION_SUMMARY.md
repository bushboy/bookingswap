  - Integrated `IntegratedFilterPanel` for advanced filtering
  - Implemented `EnhancedBookingCard` with inline proposal capabilities
  - Added `InlineProposalForm` for direct proposal submission
  - Maintained legacy view mode for backward compatibility
  - Added migration fallback for users without enhanced API access

### ✅ 2. Modify DashboardPage to show unified booking-swap information
- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Integrated `UnifiedBookingForm` for streamlined booking creation
  - Added enhanced dashboard statistics showing swap metrics
  - Updated Quick Actions to prioritize unified booking creation
  - Added real-time swap statistics display
  - Maintained existing functionality while adding enhanced features

### ✅ 3. Update navigation to reflect simplified workflow
- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Reordered navigation to prioritize Dashboard first
  - Updated "Browse" to "Browse & Swap" to reflect integrated functionality
  - Changed "My Swaps" to "Swap History" for clarity
  - Maintained all existing routes while emphasizing the simplified workflow

### ✅ 4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing bookings
- **Implementation**:
  - Added migration fallback in BrowsePage when enhanced API is unavailable
  - Created `migrateLegacyBookingsToEnhanced` function for data transformation
  - Implemented client-side filtering for legacy data
  - Maintained existing API endpoints and data structures
  - Added graceful degradation for users without enhanced features

### ✅ 5. Add migration support for existing swap data
- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/utils/migrationUtils.ts`
- **Features**:
  - `migrateLegacyBookingsToEnhanced()` - Converts legacy booking/swap data to enhanced format
  - `validateMigratedData()` - Ensures data integrity after migration
  - `createDataBackup()` - Creates backups before migration
  - `restoreFromBackup()` - Rollback capability if migration fails
  - `performGradualMigration()` - Batch processing for large datasets
  - `MigrationService` - Centralized migration management

## New Components Created

### EnhancedBookingCard
- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/components/booking/EnhancedBookingCard.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays booking information with integrated swap actions
- **Features**:
  - Role-based action buttons (owner/browser/proposer)
  - Integrated swap status indicators
  - Responsive design with hover effects
  - Support for inline proposal forms

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Browse Experience
- **Dual Mode Support**: Enhanced mode with integrated swap functionality + Legacy mode for compatibility
- **Advanced Filtering**: Swap-specific filters (available for swap, accepts cash, auction mode)
- **Inline Proposals**: Direct proposal submission from booking listings
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh after proposal submission

### 2. Unified Dashboard
- **Integrated Creation**: Single form for booking + swap setup
- **Enhanced Statistics**: Swap-specific metrics and analytics
- **Quick Actions**: Prioritized access to enhanced features
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy form access maintained

### 3. Migration & Compatibility
- **Automatic Fallback**: Graceful degradation when enhanced APIs unavailable
- **Data Migration**: Seamless conversion of legacy data structures
- **Validation**: Comprehensive data integrity checks
- **Backup & Restore**: Safe migration with rollback capabilities

### 4. Navigation Improvements
- **Simplified Workflow**: Logical flow from Dashboard → Browse & Swap → My Bookings → History
- **Clear Labeling**: Updated navigation labels reflect integrated functionality
- **Maintained Routes**: All existing routes preserved for compatibility

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 1.1: Integrated Booking and Swap Creation
✅ **Satisfied** - UnifiedBookingForm integrated into DashboardPage with single-form booking+swap creation

### Requirement 2.1: Booking Listings with Integrated Swap Actions
✅ **Satisfied** - EnhancedBookingCard displays swap information and enables inline proposals

### Requirement 3.1: Streamlined Booking Discovery and Filtering
✅ **Satisfied** - IntegratedFilterPanel provides swap-specific filtering capabilities

### Requirement 6.1: Enhanced Listing Display and Information Architecture
✅ **Satisfied** - Enhanced booking cards with clear swap indicators and information hierarchy

## Testing & Verification

### Integration Tests
- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/pages/__tests__/integration-verification.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: 6 test cases covering all integration aspects
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing

### Verification Points
1. ✅ Component structure and interfaces
2. ✅ Migration utilities functionality
3. ✅ Enhanced booking filters
4. ✅ Unified booking data structure
5. ✅ Inline proposal data structure
6. ✅ Navigation structure updates

## Backward Compatibility Measures

### API Compatibility
- Legacy API endpoints remain functional
- Enhanced endpoints provide additional functionality
- Graceful fallback when enhanced features unavailable

### Data Compatibility
- Existing booking data structures preserved
- Migration utilities handle legacy swap data
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### User Experience Compatibility
- Legacy browse mode available as fallback
- Existing navigation patterns maintained
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Migration Strategy

### Gradual Migration
- Batch processing for large datasets (50 items per batch)
- Progress reporting during migration
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed items

### Safety Measures
- Automatic backup creation before migration
- Data validation after migration
- Rollback capability if issues detected
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Enhanced API responses cached for 2-5 minutes
- ETag support for conditional requests
- Client-side filtering for legacy data

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket integration for live swap status updates
- Automatic cache invalidation on data changes
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Enhanced Analytics**: More detailed swap performance metrics
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Machine learning-based recommendation filters
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interactions and gestures
4. **Accessibility**: Enhanced screen reader support and keyboard navigation

### Migration Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Current implementation with fallback support
2. **Phase 2**: Gradual user migration to enhanced features
3. **Phase 3**: Legacy API deprecation (6+ months)
4. **Phase 4**: Full enhanced API adoption

## Conclusion

Task 16 has been successfully completed with full integration of enhanced booking-swap functionality into existing pages and routing. The implementation provides:

- ✅ **Seamless Integration**: Enhanced features work alongside existing functionality
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: No disruption to existing users or data
- ✅ **Migration Support**: Comprehensive tools for data transformation
