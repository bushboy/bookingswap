- Relationship integrity maintenance

## API Endpoint Mapping

### Booking Edit Service Endpoints
```
POST   /bookings/edit-only                    - Create booking (no swap)
PUT    /bookings/:id/edit-only               - Update booking (no swap)
GET    /bookings/:id/edit-only               - Get booking (no swap info)
GET    /bookings/edit-only                   - Get user bookings (no swap info)
DELETE /bookings/:id/edit-only               - Delete booking (if no active swaps)
GET    /bookings/:id/can-edit                - Check edit permissions
GET    /bookings/:id/edit-history            - Get edit history
```

### Swap Specification Service Endpoints
```
POST   /swaps/specification                  - Create swap specification
PUT    /swaps/specification/:id              - Update swap specification
GET    /swaps/specification/:id              - Get swap specification
GET    /swaps/specification/by-booking/:id   - Get swap by booking ID
GET    /swaps/specification/context/:id      - Get swap context (with booking info)
POST   /bookings/:id/enable-swapping         - Enable swapping (create spec + mint NFT)
POST   /bookings/:id/disable-swapping        - Disable swapping (remove spec + burn NFT)
GET    /swaps/specification/:id/can-modify   - Check modification permissions
GET    /swaps/specification/:id/history      - Get modification history
GET    /swaps/specification/:id/auction      - Get active auction info
```

### Combined Operations Endpoints
```
POST   /bookings/with-swap/atomic            - Create booking with swap (atomic)
PUT    /bookings/:id/with-swap/atomic        - Update booking with swap (atomic)
GET    /bookings/:id/combined-data           - Get combined booking and swap data
POST   /operations/atomic-transaction        - Perform atomic transaction
```

## Error Recovery Patterns

### Pattern 1: Field-by-Field Recovery
```typescript
// When validation fails for multiple fields
const result = await bookingEditService.updateBookingWithRecovery(bookingId, data);
if (!result.success) {
  result.partialFailures?.forEach(failure => {
    console.log(`Field ${failure.field} failed: ${failure.error}`);
    // Handle individual field failures
  });
}
```

### Pattern 2: Snapshot and Rollback
```typescript
// Before complex operations
const snapshot = await apiErrorRecoveryService.createSnapshot('op-123', bookingId);
try {
  // Perform operations
} catch (error) {
  // Rollback using snapshot
  await apiErrorRecoveryService.recoverFromPartialFailure('op-123', failures, {
    type: 'rollback',
    rollbackToSnapshot: true
  });
}
```

### Pattern 3: Combined Operation Recovery
```typescript
// For operations affecting both booking and swap
const result = await combinedBookingSwapService.updateBookingWithSwapRecovery(bookingId, data);
if (!result.success) {
  result.partialFailures?.forEach(failure => {
    if (failure.operation === 'booking') {
      // Handle booking-specific failures
    } else if (failure.operation === 'swap') {
      // Handle swap-specific failures
    }
  });
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies ✅
- **Separate API calls**: Avoid loading unnecessary data
- **Caching mechanisms**: Reduce redundant API calls
- **Atomic operations**: Only when necessary to avoid overhead
- **Recovery batching**: Group recovery operations for efficiency

### Monitoring Metrics
- Operation success rates by service type
- Recovery operation frequency and success rates
- Data consistency validation results
- Performance timing for each operation type

## Security Compliance ✅

### Data Separation Security
- Booking data cannot contain swap fields
- Swap data cannot contain booking fields
- Cross-service data validation prevents injection attacks
- Audit trails for all operations

### Permission Validation
- Edit permissions checked before booking operations
- Modification permissions checked before swap operations
- User ownership validation for all operations
- Rate limiting for recovery operations

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Service Separation ✅
- Booking edit service handles pure booking operations
- Swap specification service handles pure swap operations
- Combined service handles atomic operations

### Phase 2: Error Recovery ✅
- Partial failure recovery mechanisms
- Data consistency validation
- Automatic repair capabilities

### Phase 3: Integration ✅
- Frontend integration with separated services
- Error handling UI components
- Recovery strategy user interfaces

## Conclusion

The API services have been successfully separated with comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms. The implementation maintains data consistency while providing robust failure recovery options. All services comply with the data model separation requirements and provide appropriate error handling for various failure scenarios.

### Key Benefits Achieved:
1. **Clear separation of concerns** between booking and swap operations
2. **Robust error handling** with multiple recovery strategies
3. **Data consistency guarantees** through validation and repair mechanisms
4. **Comprehensive audit trails** for all operations
5. **Performance optimization** through targeted API calls
6. **Security compliance** through data separation and permission validation

The separated API services are ready for production use with full error recovery capabilities.
