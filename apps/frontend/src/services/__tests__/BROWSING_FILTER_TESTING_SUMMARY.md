## Key Testing Features

### 1. Core Filtering Rules Validation
All tests validate the three core filtering rules:
- **Exclude user's own swaps**: Users cannot see swaps they created
- **Exclude cancelled bookings**: Cancelled bookings are hidden from browse results
- **Require active proposals**: Only swaps with active proposals are shown

### 2. Performance Benchmarks
- **Small datasets (< 1,000 items)**: < 50ms filtering time
- **Medium datasets (1,000-5,000 items)**: < 100ms filtering time
- **Large datasets (5,000-10,000 items)**: < 300ms filtering time
- **Memory efficiency**: No excessive intermediate arrays or memory leaks

### 3. Accessibility Compliance
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**: All filtering interfaces pass accessibility audits
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard support for all filtering operations
- **Screen reader support**: Proper announcements for filter changes and results
- **Focus management**: Proper focus handling during filter operations

### 4. User Experience Testing
- **Real-time updates**: Filters apply immediately as users type/change settings
- **Filter persistence**: Filters maintain state during data updates
- **Empty states**: Proper messaging when no results match filters
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when filtering fails

### 5. Integration Testing
- **Component integration**: Filters work correctly with UI components
- **API integration**: Filters integrate properly with backend services
- **State management**: Filters work correctly with Redux state
- **Search integration**: Filters combine properly with search functionality

## Test Execution Results
