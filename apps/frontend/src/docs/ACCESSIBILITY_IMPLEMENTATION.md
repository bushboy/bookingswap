- **Purpose**: Detects and supports high contrast mode
- **Features**:
  - Detects Windows high contrast mode and CSS prefers-contrast
  - Provides appropriate styling for high contrast environments
  - Supports multiple high contrast detection methods

### 2. Accessibility Utilities (`accessibility.ts`)

#### ARIA Attribute Generators
- `getFormFieldAria()`: Generates ARIA attributes for form fields
