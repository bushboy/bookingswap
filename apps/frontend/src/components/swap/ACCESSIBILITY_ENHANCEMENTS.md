- **Authorization Errors**: Explains permission issues clearly
- **Circuit Breaker**: Announces when service is temporarily unavailable

### State Change Announcements
- **Swap Selection**: Announces when a swap is selected and form is shown
- **Navigation**: Announces when returning to swap selection
- **Submission**: Provides detailed submission progress updates
- **Compatibility Updates**: Announces when compatibility scores are refreshed

## ARIA Labels and Attributes

### Modal Structure
- `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal="true"`
- `aria-describedby` linking to comprehensive modal description
- Hidden descriptions for screen readers explaining modal purpose and navigation

### Loading States
- `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"` for loading regions
- `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` for loading descriptions
- Individual skeleton loaders have descriptive labels

### Swap Selection Cards
- `role="button"` with proper `tabIndex` for keyboard navigation
- Comprehensive `aria-label` including swap details and compatibility
- `aria-describedby` linking to detailed swap information
- `aria-disabled` state during submission

### Compatibility Scores
- Interactive compatibility score buttons with proper ARIA labels
- Hidden help text explaining compatibility scoring system
- `aria-describedby` linking to compatibility explanations

### Form Elements
- Proper `aria-labelledby` for form sections
- `aria-describedby` for form descriptions and help text
- `aria-invalid` and error associations for validation states

## Keyboard Navigation

### Navigation Support
- Full Tab navigation through all interactive elements
- Enter/Space key support for buttons and interactive elements
- Escape key support for modal dismissal
- Focus trapping within modal boundaries

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Alt+R**: Retry failed operations (loading or submission)
- **Alt+B**: Back to swap selection when in form view
- **Alt+C**: Clear error messages
- **Escape**: Close modal
- **Tab**: Navigate between elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and select swaps

### Keyboard Help
- Toggleable keyboard shortcuts panel
- Context-sensitive shortcut display (shows relevant shortcuts based on current state)
- Proper `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for help panel

## Focus Management

### Focus Restoration
- Saves and restores focus when modal opens/closes
- Proper focus trapping within modal
- Logical tab order through all interactive elements

### Visual Focus Indicators
- Maintains browser default focus indicators
- Ensures focus is visible on all interactive elements
- Proper focus management during state changes

## Error Handling Accessibility

### Error Announcements
- Immediate announcement of errors with `aria-live="assertive"`
- Context-specific error messages with recovery guidance
- Clear distinction between different error types

### Error Recovery
- Keyboard shortcuts for common recovery actions
- Clear labeling of retry buttons and actions
- Guidance on next steps for different error scenarios

## Compatibility with Assistive Technologies

### Screen Reader Support
- Comprehensive announcements for all state changes
- Proper semantic markup with ARIA roles and properties
- Hidden descriptive text for complex UI elements

### High Contrast Mode
- Maintains functionality in high contrast mode
- Proper color contrast ratios for all text
- Visual indicators don't rely solely on color

### Reduced Motion
- Respects user's reduced motion preferences
- Essential animations maintained for functionality
- No motion-dependent interactions

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Verify keyboard-only navigation
- Test in high contrast mode
- Verify with reduced motion settings

### Automated Testing
- ARIA attribute validation
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Focus management verification
- Announcement content validation

## Implementation Details

### Key Components Enhanced
- `MakeProposalModal.tsx`: Main modal component with full accessibility support
- `useAccessibility.ts`: Enhanced with additional announcement capabilities
- Modal structure with proper ARIA landmarks and descriptions

### Dependencies
- Uses existing `useAnnouncements` hook for screen reader announcements
- Integrates with `useKeyboardNavigation` for keyboard support
- Maintains compatibility with existing responsive design system

## Compliance

These enhancements help ensure compliance with:
- WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Section 508 accessibility standards
- Modern accessibility best practices
- Screen reader compatibility requirements

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Voice control support
- Enhanced keyboard shortcuts customization
- More granular announcement preferences
- Integration with browser accessibility APIs
