# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend application is experiencing critical import failures due to missing core UI components (Button and Card). Multiple components throughout the application are attempting to import these essential UI building blocks, but the actual component files don't exist. This is causing build failures and preventing the application from running properly. The missing components need to be implemented to restore application functionality and provide a consistent UI foundation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want core UI components (Button and Card) to exist and be properly implemented, so that the application can build and run without import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL NOT show "Failed to load url" errors for Button and Card components
2. WHEN components import Button from "./Button" or "../ui/Button" THEN the system SHALL successfully resolve the import
3. WHEN components import Card from "./Card" or "../ui/Card" THEN the system SHALL successfully resolve the import
4. WHEN the UI index.ts file exports Button and Card THEN the system SHALL have actual component files to export

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Button component to provide consistent styling and behavior across the application, so that all interactive elements have a unified look and feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Button component is rendered THEN the system SHALL display a clickable button element
2. WHEN Button receives different variant props THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate styling (primary, secondary, danger, etc.)
3. WHEN Button receives a disabled prop THEN the system SHALL render the button in a disabled state
4. WHEN Button receives click handlers THEN the system SHALL execute the provided onClick function
5. WHEN Button receives children or text content THEN the system SHALL display the content within the button

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Card component to provide consistent container styling across the application, so that content can be organized in visually cohesive sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Card component is rendered THEN the system SHALL display a styled container element
2. WHEN Card contains CardHeader, CardContent, or CardFooter THEN the system SHALL render these sections with appropriate spacing and styling
3. WHEN Card receives className props THEN the system SHALL apply additional custom styling
4. WHEN Card is used in different contexts THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual appearance
5. WHEN Card components are nested or used alongside other UI elements THEN the system SHALL maintain proper layout and spacing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI components to be accessible and follow best practices, so that the application is usable by all users including those with disabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Button components are rendered THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support
2. WHEN Button is disabled THEN the system SHALL communicate the disabled state to screen readers
3. WHEN Card components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use semantic HTML elements where appropriate
4. WHEN components receive focus THEN the system SHALL provide visible focus indicators
5. WHEN components are used with screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful accessibility information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the components to be TypeScript-compatible with proper type definitions, so that I get compile-time type checking and better development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing Button or Card components THEN the system SHALL provide proper TypeScript type definitions
2. WHEN using component props THEN the system SHALL validate prop types at compile time
3. WHEN extending or customizing components THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript interfaces and generics
4. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL NOT show TypeScript errors related to these components
