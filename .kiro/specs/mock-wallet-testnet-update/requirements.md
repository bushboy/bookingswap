# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Update the mock wallet configuration across all test files to use the user's specific testnet wallet address (0.0.6199687) instead of the generic placeholder addresses currently used in the test suite.

## Glossary

- **Mock_Wallet_System**: The test infrastructure that simulates wallet connections and interactions for automated testing
- **Testnet_Wallet_Address**: A Hedera testnet account identifier in the format 0.0.XXXXXX used for testing blockchain interactions
- **Test_Suite**: The collection of automated tests including e2e, integration, and unit tests
- **Wallet_Provider_Mock**: Test doubles that simulate real wallet provider APIs (HashPack, Blade, Kabila)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use my specific testnet wallet address in all mock configurations, so that tests run with consistent and realistic wallet data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Mock_Wallet_System initializes, THE Mock_Wallet_System SHALL use wallet address 0.0.6199687 as the primary test account
2. WHEN test files reference mock wallet addresses, THE Test_Suite SHALL consistently use 0.0.6199687 instead of placeholder addresses
3. WHEN wallet provider mocks are created, THE Wallet_Provider_Mock SHALL return 0.0.6199687 as the connected account ID
4. WHEN database test data is seeded, THE Test_Suite SHALL use 0.0.6199687 for blockchain-related fields
5. THE Mock_Wallet_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing test assertions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all wallet-related test configurations centralized, so that future wallet address changes require minimal updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test_Suite SHALL define wallet configuration in a centralized location
2. WHEN wallet addresses need to be updated, THE Mock_Wallet_System SHALL require changes in only one configuration file
3. THE Test_Suite SHALL import wallet configuration from the centralized source
4. WHEN new tests are added, THE Test_Suite SHALL use the centralized wallet configuration by default
5. THE Mock_Wallet_System SHALL provide clear documentation for wallet configuration usage
