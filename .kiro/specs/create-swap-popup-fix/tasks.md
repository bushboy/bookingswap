# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Add comprehensive diagnostic logging to trace modal opening flow
  - Add console logging to BrowsePage button click handlers
  - Add state change logging for isProposalModalOpen and selectedBookingForProposal
  - Add logging to MakeProposalModal component render method
  - Log authentication status and user data during proposal attempts
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 2. Execute diagnostic flow to identify failure point
  - Test proposal button clicks and trace console output
  - Verify handleProposalAttempt function execution
  - Check authentication validation flow
  - Confirm modal state changes are occurring
  - Identify where the execution flow breaks
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Validate modal component and props
  - Verify MakeProposalModal import is correct
  - Check that modal receives isOpen prop as true
  - Validate targetSwap data structure and content
  - Confirm modal conditional rendering logic
  - Check for any TypeScript compilation errors
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.3, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Check for CSS and styling issues
  - Inspect modal element in browser developer tools
  - Verify modal is not hidden by CSS (display, visibility, opacity)
  - Check z-index and positioning properties
  - Confirm modal backdrop and overlay are rendering
  - Test modal responsiveness and viewport issues
  - _Requirements: 4.5, 5.3_

- [ ] 5. Implement targeted fix based on diagnostic findings
  - Fix the specific issue identified in the diagnostic phase
  - Restore modal opening functionality
  - Ensure all existing modal features continue to work
  - Test fix across different scenarios and user states
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Clean up diagnostic code and prevent regression
  - Remove or reduce excessive console logging
  - Add error boundaries if JavaScript errors were found
  - Improve error handling for modal opening failures
  - Document the fix and root cause for future reference
  - _Requirements: 5.5, 3.4_

- [ ]* 7. Add automated tests to prevent future regressions
  - Write unit tests for modal opening flow
  - Add integration tests for button click to modal display
  - Create tests for authentication and validation scenarios
  - Test modal rendering with various prop combinations
  - _Requirements: 5.5_
