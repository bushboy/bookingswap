# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a regression where the create swap popup (MakeProposalModal) has stopped appearing when users attempt to create swap proposals. The modal was previously working, so this focuses on diagnosing what has changed and restoring the functionality.

## Glossary

- **MakeProposalModal**: The React component that displays the swap creation popup interface
- **BrowsePage**: The main page where users can browse available swaps and create proposals
- **Proposal Button**: The UI element that triggers the MakeProposalModal when clicked
- **Authentication State**: The current login status of the user
- **Modal State**: The visibility and data state of the MakeProposalModal component
- **Console Errors**: JavaScript errors that appear in the browser's developer console
- **Network Requests**: HTTP requests made to the backend API during proposal creation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify what has changed in the proposal button functionality, so that I can understand why the modal stopped working

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL verify that proposal buttons are still rendering on the BrowsePage
2. THE System SHALL confirm that button click handlers are properly attached
3. THE System SHALL validate that authentication state is correctly detected
4. THE System SHALL check that button states reflect the correct proposal status
5. THE System SHALL ensure no recent code changes have broken the button functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to trace the modal opening flow, so that I can identify where the process is failing

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a proposal button is clicked, THE System SHALL log the handleProposalAttempt execution
2. THE System SHALL verify that authentication checks are passing correctly
3. THE System SHALL confirm that isProposalModalOpen state is being set to true
4. THE System SHALL validate that selectedBookingForProposal is being populated with correct data
5. THE System SHALL ensure the MakeProposalModal component receives the isOpen prop as true

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify any JavaScript errors or console warnings, so that I can pinpoint the root cause of the modal failure

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL capture and log any JavaScript errors during button clicks
2. THE System SHALL identify any React rendering errors in the MakeProposalModal component
3. THE System SHALL detect any missing dependencies or import issues
4. THE System SHALL verify that all required props are being passed to the modal
5. THE System SHALL check for any TypeScript compilation errors affecting the modal

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to compare the current implementation with the working version, so that I can identify what has regressed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL verify that the MakeProposalModal component is still properly imported
2. THE System SHALL confirm that modal state management hasn't been altered
3. THE System SHALL check that no recent changes have affected the modal rendering logic
4. THE System SHALL validate that the modal's conditional rendering logic is intact
5. THE System SHALL ensure that no CSS or styling changes are hiding the modal

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to restore the modal functionality, so that users can create swap proposals again

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL fix any identified issues preventing the modal from opening
2. THE MakeProposalModal SHALL display when isProposalModalOpen is set to true
3. THE Modal SHALL receive correct props and render without errors
4. THE System SHALL maintain all existing modal functionality after the fix
5. THE System SHALL prevent similar regressions through improved error handling
