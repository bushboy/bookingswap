# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The My Bookings page provides users with a centralized dashboard to view and manage all their personal bookings. This page serves as the primary interface for users to track their reservations, monitor swap activities, and perform basic booking management tasks. Unlike the browse swaps page which focuses on discovering other users' bookings, the My Bookings page is specifically designed for personal booking management with minimal filtering and maximum clarity on booking status and available actions.
