# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix AcceptanceStrategySelector border property conflict



  - Replace mixed border shorthand and borderColor usage with consistent border shorthand approach
  - Update selectedOptionStyles to use complete border property instead of borderColor override
  - Test component rendering to ensure no console warnings appear
  - Verify visual appearance remains identical to current design
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Create unit tests for AcceptanceStrategySelector styling





  - Write tests to verify component renders without React warnings
  - Test that style objects don't contain conflicting CSS properties
  - Verify component functionality remains unchanged after style fixes
  - Test different component states (selected, disabled, error states)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Audit codebase for additional CSS property conflicts





  - Search for other instances of mixed shorthand/non-shorthand property usage across frontend components
  - Document findings with component names, file paths, and conflict types
  - Prioritize fixes based on component usage and warning frequency
  - Create a systematic approach for resolving each identified conflict
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Fix identified CSS conflicts in other components









  - Apply consistent property usage patterns to all identified components
  - Use the same border shorthand approach established in AcceptanceStrategySelector
  - Preserve original visual design and functionality for each component
  - Test each component individually after applying fixes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Create comprehensive tests for all fixed components





  - Write unit tests for each component to verify no CSS property conflicts
  - Implement visual regression tests to ensure no unintended styling changes
  - Test component interactions and state changes
  - Verify responsive behavior is maintained across all fixed components
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Establish CSS property usage guidelines







  - Document best practices for consistent CSS property usage in components
  - Create code examples showing correct shorthand vs individual property usage
  - Add guidelines to prevent future CSS property conflicts
  - Consider implementing linting rules to catch conflicts during development
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
