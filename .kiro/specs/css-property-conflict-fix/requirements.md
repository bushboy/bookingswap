# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses CSS property conflicts in React components where shorthand and non-shorthand CSS properties are mixed, causing React warnings during re-renders. The specific issue occurs when both `border` (shorthand) and `borderColor` (non-shorthand) properties are applied to the same element, leading to styling inconsistencies and console warnings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate CSS property conflicts in React components, so that the application runs without styling warnings and maintains consistent visual appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a React component renders THEN the system SHALL NOT generate warnings about conflicting CSS properties
2. WHEN shorthand CSS properties are used THEN the system SHALL NOT mix them with related non-shorthand properties on the same element
3. WHEN styling is applied to components THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing visual appearance and behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent approach to CSS property usage across components, so that future styling conflicts are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining component styles THEN the system SHALL use either shorthand OR non-shorthand properties consistently for the same CSS category
2. WHEN border styling is applied THEN the system SHALL use either `border` shorthand OR individual `borderWidth`, `borderStyle`, `borderColor` properties
3. WHEN component styles are updated THEN the system SHALL validate that no property conflicts exist

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AcceptanceStrategySelector component to function without console warnings, so that the application performs optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AcceptanceStrategySelector component renders THEN the system SHALL NOT generate border property conflict warnings
2. WHEN the selected state changes THEN the system SHALL apply styling without property conflicts
3. WHEN the component re-renders THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent border styling appearance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix similar CSS conflicts across the entire application, so that all components are free from styling warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all instances of mixed shorthand/non-shorthand property usage
2. WHEN CSS conflicts are found THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent resolution approach
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL preserve the original visual design and functionality
