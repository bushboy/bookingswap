#### Configuration Updates
- Updated ESLint configuration to include custom CSS conflict rule
- Enhanced VS Code settings for better developer experience
- Integrated conflict detection into pre-commit workflow

## üìä Current State Analysis

### Conflicts Detected
The automated scan identified **84 files** with CSS property conflicts:

#### Conflict Distribution:
- **Border conflicts**: 45+ files (mixing `border` with `borderColor`, `borderWidth`, etc.)
- **Margin conflicts**: 60+ files (mixing `margin` with `marginTop`, `marginLeft`, etc.)  
- **Padding conflicts**: 25+ files (mixing `padding` with `paddingTop`, `paddingLeft`, etc.)
- **Background conflicts**: 15+ files (mixing `background` with `backgroundColor`, etc.)
- **Font conflicts**: 5+ files (mixing `font` with `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, etc.)

#### Affected Component Categories:
- UI Components (Input, Button, Modal, Error handling)
- Booking Components (Forms, cards, lists, filters)
- Swap Components (Creation, management, status tracking)
- Payment Components (Forms, verification, security)
- Layout Components (Headers, navigation, dashboards)

## üéØ Requirements Fulfillment

### Requirement 2.1: Consistent CSS Property Usage
‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
