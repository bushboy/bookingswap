# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend error recovery service is missing the `executeWithRecovery` method that is being called throughout the application, particularly in BookingActions.tsx. This method is expected to execute operations with basic retry logic, but is not implemented in the current ErrorRecoveryService class. The application is failing with "TypeError: errorRecoveryService.executeWithRecovery is not a function" when trying to create swaps or perform other booking actions.

## Glossary

- **ErrorRecoveryService**: Frontend service responsible for handling error recovery strategies
- **Recovery Operation**: An asynchronous function that may fail and needs basic retry logic

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the swap creation process to work without throwing method errors, so that I can successfully create swaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the create swap button, THE ErrorRecoveryService SHALL have an executeWithRecovery method available
2. WHEN the executeWithRecovery method is called, THE ErrorRecoveryService SHALL execute the provided operation
3. WHEN the operation succeeds, THE ErrorRecoveryService SHALL return the successful result
4. WHEN the operation fails, THE ErrorRecoveryService SHALL return an appropriate error response
