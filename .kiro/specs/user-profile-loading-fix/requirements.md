# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `/swaps` component is displaying a "User Profile Not Loaded" error because there's a disconnect between the AuthContext (which properly loads user data from localStorage) and the Redux authSlice (which the ReceivedProposalsSection component relies on). Users who are authenticated and have valid tokens stored in localStorage cannot interact with their proposals because the Redux store doesn't contain their user data.

## Glossary

- **AuthContext**: The React context that manages authentication state and loads user data from localStorage
- **Redux_Store**: The Redux store that contains the auth slice with user state
- **ReceivedProposalsSection**: The component that displays proposals and shows the "User Profile Not Loaded" error
- **LocalStorage_Data**: User authentication data stored in browser localStorage (auth_token, auth_user)
- **User_Profile**: The user object containing id, username, email, and other user information
- **Auth_Synchronization**: The process of keeping AuthContext and Redux store in sync

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user with valid credentials in localStorage, I want the swaps component to load my user profile automatically, so that I can see and interact with my proposals without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes, THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL load user data from LocalStorage_Data into the Redux_Store
2. WHEN user data exists in AuthContext, THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL update the Redux_Store with the same user information
3. WHEN the ReceivedProposalsSection renders, THE Redux_Store SHALL contain valid User_Profile data
4. THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL maintain consistency between AuthContext and Redux_Store throughout the session
5. WHEN user logs out, THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL clear both AuthContext and Redux_Store user data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the "User Profile Not Loaded" error, I want the system to automatically retry loading my profile, so that I don't have to manually refresh the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN User_Profile data is missing from Redux_Store, THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL attempt to load from AuthContext
2. WHEN AuthContext contains valid user data, THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL populate the Redux_Store immediately
3. WHEN both AuthContext and Redux_Store are empty, THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL attempt to load from LocalStorage_Data
4. THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL provide error recovery mechanisms for failed synchronization attempts
5. WHEN synchronization fails, THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication state to be consistent across all components, so that there are no conflicts between different authentication systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL ensure AuthContext and Redux_Store contain identical user data
2. WHEN user data changes in AuthContext, THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL update Redux_Store within 100ms
3. WHEN user logs in through AuthContext, THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL immediately update Redux_Store
4. THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL handle race conditions between AuthContext and Redux_Store updates
5. THE Auth_Synchronization SHALL provide debugging information in development mode for authentication state mismatches
