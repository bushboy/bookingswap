# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze and identify targeting authentication issues





  - Investigate targeting-specific API endpoints that cause authentication failures
  - Add comprehensive logging to identify where authentication fails for users with outgoing targets
  - Document the differences in token validation between swap and targeting endpoints
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Implement authentication error classification system





- [x] 2.1 Create enhanced error classification for targeting-related failures


  - Extend AuthErrorType enum to include targeting-specific error types
  - Implement error classification logic to distinguish targeting vs genuine auth failures
  - Add shouldTriggerLogout flag to prevent unnecessary logouts
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2.2 Update error handling to preserve authentication state


  - Modify authentication error handlers to not corrupt main auth state for targeting errors
  - Implement targeting-specific error handling that maintains user session
  - Add logic to only trigger logout for genuine token invalidity
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Fix SwapsPage authentication flow for targeting users





- [x] 3.1 Implement targeting data loading isolation


  - Separate targeting data loading from main swap data loading
  - Add independent error states for targeting operations
  - Implement targeting-specific retry logic that doesn't affect main auth state
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 3.2 Add targeting authentication validation


  - Implement pre-validation for targeting-related API calls
  - Add targeting-specific token validation that matches main auth validation
  - Ensure consistent authentication logic across all targeting endpoints
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3.3 Update SwapsPage state management for targeting errors


  - Add targetingState to track targeting-specific loading and errors
  - Implement separate error handling for targeting vs main swap data
  - Add user feedback for targeting-specific issues without affecting main UI
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 4. Enhance API authentication consistency





- [x] 4.1 Fix targeting API endpoints authentication validation


  - Review and fix targeting-related API endpoints to use consistent token validation
  - Ensure targeting endpoints properly validate tokens without false positives
  - Add proper error responses that distinguish auth failures from authorization issues
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 4.2 Update API request interceptors for targeting operations


  - Enhance request interceptors to handle targeting-specific authentication
  - Add targeting operation identification in request metadata
  - Implement different error handling strategies for targeting vs main operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring










- [x] 5.1 Add targeting-specific authentication logging

  - Log all targeting-related authentication attempts and failures

  - Add detailed logging for token validation in targeting operations
  - Implement logging that helps identify false positive authentication failures
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5.2 Add user feedback for targeting authentication issues

  - Implement clear error messages for targeting-specific authentication problems
  - Add user feedback that explains targeting issues without suggesting logout
  - Provide retry options for targeting operations that don't affect main session
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ]* 6. Add comprehensive testing for targeting authentication
- [ ]* 6.1 Create unit tests for targeting authentication scenarios
  - Test authentication error classification for targeting operations
  - Test that targeting failures don't corrupt main authentication state
  - Test retry logic for targeting operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ]* 6.2 Create integration tests for users with outgoing targets
  - Test complete flow for users with outgoing targets accessing My Swaps page
  - Test authentication behavior during targeting data loading
  - Test error recovery for targeting authentication failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ]* 6.3 Add end-to-end tests for targeting authentication scenarios
  - Test user journey with outgoing targets from login to My Swaps page
  - Test behavior when targeting endpoints have authentication issues
  - Test that users remain logged in when targeting operations fail
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
