# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical authentication issue where users with incoming swaps experience a disruptive redirect to the login page after briefly viewing their swaps on the My Swaps page. The issue manifests as swaps displaying momentarily before the user is unexpectedly redirected to login, creating a poor user experience and suggesting an authentication token validation or session management problem specific to the swaps viewing functionality.

## Glossary

- **My Swaps Page**: The authenticated user interface displaying a user's incoming and outgoing swap proposals
- **Authentication System**: The frontend and backend components responsible for user login, token management, and access control
- **Session Management**: The system responsible for maintaining user authentication state across page loads and API calls
- **Token Validation**: The process of verifying JWT token format, signature, and expiration status
- **Incoming Swaps**: Swap proposals that other users have made to the current user
- **Authentication Redirect**: The automatic redirection of users to the login page when authentication fails

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with incoming swaps, I want to view my swaps without being unexpectedly redirected to login, so that I can manage my swap proposals effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with valid authentication accesses the My Swaps page, THE Authentication System SHALL maintain the user session throughout the page load
2. WHEN the My Swaps page loads swap data, THE Authentication System SHALL not trigger authentication redirects for valid sessions
3. WHEN swap data is being fetched, THE Authentication System SHALL preserve the user's authentication state without interruption
4. THE My Swaps Page SHALL display swaps consistently without momentary flashing followed by redirects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication token to be properly validated before accessing the My Swaps page, so that I don't experience confusing authentication failures after the page loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the My Swaps page, THE Authentication System SHALL validate the token before rendering the page content
2. WHEN token validation fails during navigation, THE Authentication System SHALL redirect to login immediately without showing swap content
3. WHEN token validation succeeds, THE Authentication System SHALL allow full page rendering and data loading without subsequent redirects
4. THE Authentication System SHALL not perform redundant token validations that could cause mid-page redirects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with incoming swaps, I want the swap data loading process to handle authentication errors gracefully, so that I receive clear feedback about authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN swap data loading encounters authentication errors, THE Authentication System SHALL provide clear error messaging before redirecting
2. WHEN authentication fails during data loading, THE Authentication System SHALL preserve the user's intended action for post-login restoration
3. WHEN multiple API calls are made for swap data, THE Authentication System SHALL handle authentication consistently across all requests
4. THE Authentication System SHALL not cause partial page loads that show data briefly before authentication failures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging authentication issues, I want comprehensive logging of the authentication flow on the My Swaps page, so that I can identify the root cause of unexpected redirects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the My Swaps page loads, THE Authentication System SHALL log token validation steps and results
2. WHEN API calls are made for swap data, THE Authentication System SHALL log authentication headers and responses
3. WHEN authentication redirects occur, THE Authentication System SHALL log the specific trigger and timing of the redirect
4. THE Authentication System SHALL provide detailed error information for authentication failures without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent authentication behavior across all swap-related pages, so that I have a predictable experience when managing my swaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any swap-related functionality, THE Authentication System SHALL apply consistent token validation logic
2. WHEN authentication state changes, THE Authentication System SHALL update all swap-related pages uniformly
3. WHEN session expires, THE Authentication System SHALL handle logout consistently across all swap interfaces
4. THE Authentication System SHALL maintain authentication state consistency between page navigation and API calls
