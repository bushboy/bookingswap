# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance AuthContext with token validation





  - Add token validation function that checks JWT format, expiration, and required claims
  - Implement token validation on AuthContext initialization to handle expired tokens in storage
  - Add periodic token validation (every 60 seconds) to detect expiration during active sessions
  - Add helper function to clear authentication storage consistently
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 2. Restructure router configuration for public and protected routes





  - Modify router configuration to separate public routes (/, /browse) from protected routes
  - Make root path (/) default to Browse Page without authentication requirement
  - Keep existing protected routes (/bookings, /swaps) under ProtectedRoute wrapper
  - Ensure authentication routes (/login, /register, /auth/*) remain public
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Update Layout component for conditional rendering





  - Modify Layout component to handle both authenticated and unauthenticated states
  - Pass authentication status to child components (Header, Sidebar)
  - Ensure Layout works correctly in both public and protected route contexts
  - Add loading state handling during authentication checks
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Update navigation components based on authentication status





  - Modify Sidebar component to conditionally show navigation items based on auth status
  - Update Header component to show login/register buttons for unauthenticated users
  - Show user menu and logout option for authenticated users
  - Hide protected route links (/bookings, /swaps) from unauthenticated users
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Enhance Browse Page for unauthenticated users





  - Update Browse Page to handle both authenticated and unauthenticated states
  - Add authentication prompts for protected actions (making proposals)
  - Implement redirect logic that preserves user intent after login
  - Add call-to-action banner encouraging unauthenticated users to sign up
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 6. Update LoginForm to handle return path redirects





  - Modify LoginForm to read intended destination from location state
  - Implement redirect logic to send users back to their intended page after successful login
  - Handle special cases like proposal creation from browse page
  - Default to /browse for users without a specific return path
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4_

- [ ]* 7. Add comprehensive error handling and user messaging
  - Create error display components for token expiration scenarios
  - Add user-friendly messages for authentication requirements
  - Implement error boundaries for authentication-related errors
  - Add logging for token validation failures and authentication events
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 5.4_

- [ ]* 8. Write unit tests for token validation functions
  - Test token validation with valid tokens, expired tokens, and invalid formats
  - Test AuthContext initialization with various token states
  - Test periodic validation behavior and logout triggers
  - Test error handling for malformed tokens and missing claims
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ]* 9. Write integration tests for routing behavior
  - Test public route accessibility without authentication
  - Test protected route redirects for unauthenticated users
  - Test authentication state changes and route access
  - Test return path preservation during login flows
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ]* 10. Add end-to-end tests for authentication flows
  - Test complete user journey from unauthenticated browsing to authenticated access
  - Test token expiration scenarios during active sessions
  - Test cross-tab authentication synchronization
  - Test security scenarios with expired and manipulated tokens
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
