# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for restructuring the application's routing to make `/browse` the default public view, while protecting `/bookings` and `/swaps` routes for authenticated users only. Additionally, it includes comprehensive token validation to ensure expired tokens are properly handled, improving both security and user experience.

## Glossary

- **Authentication System**: The frontend and backend components responsible for user login, token management, and access control
- **Protected Route**: A route that requires user authentication to access, redirecting unauthenticated users to login
- **Public Route**: A route accessible without authentication
- **Token Validation**: The process of verifying JWT token format, signature, and expiration status
- **Browse Page**: The public page displaying available swaps that users can view without authentication
- **Layout Component**: The main UI wrapper component that provides navigation and structure for both authenticated and unauthenticated users

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated visitor, I want to browse available swaps without logging in, so that I can explore the platform before committing to registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user visits the root URL, THE Authentication System SHALL display the Browse Page
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user navigates to `/browse`, THE Authentication System SHALL display available swaps without requiring authentication
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to perform authenticated actions on the Browse Page, THE Authentication System SHALL prompt for login with clear messaging
4. THE Authentication System SHALL preserve the user's intended action after successful login from the Browse Page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to protect sensitive user data and booking functionality, so that only authenticated users can access personal information and booking management features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access `/bookings`, THE Authentication System SHALL redirect to the login page
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access `/swaps`, THE Authentication System SHALL redirect to the login page
3. WHEN an authenticated user accesses `/bookings` or `/swaps`, THE Authentication System SHALL grant access without redirection
4. THE Authentication System SHALL preserve the intended destination URL during authentication redirects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with an expired authentication token, I want to be immediately logged out and redirected to login, so that I don't encounter confusing errors or security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes with an expired token in storage, THE Authentication System SHALL clear the token and treat the user as unauthenticated
2. WHEN a token expires during an active session, THE Authentication System SHALL automatically log out the user within 60 seconds
3. WHEN a user with an expired token attempts to access protected routes, THE Authentication System SHALL redirect to login with an appropriate message
4. THE Authentication System SHALL validate token expiration before each API request and on periodic intervals

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user navigating the application, I want consistent and appropriate navigation options based on my authentication status, so that I can easily access relevant features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user views the navigation, THE Layout Component SHALL display login and register options
2. WHEN an authenticated user views the navigation, THE Layout Component SHALL display user menu and protected route links
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user views the navigation, THE Layout Component SHALL hide links to `/bookings` and `/swaps`
4. THE Layout Component SHALL display the Browse link to all users regardless of authentication status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the authentication system, I want robust token validation that prevents security vulnerabilities, so that expired or invalid tokens never grant access to protected resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication System SHALL validate JWT token format before accepting any token
2. THE Authentication System SHALL check token expiration with a 30-second buffer to account for clock skew
3. THE Authentication System SHALL perform token validation on application initialization and every 60 seconds during active sessions
4. IF token validation fails at any point, THEN THE Authentication System SHALL clear stored credentials and log out the user
