# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical performance issues with wallet selection where the wallet selection modal either doesn't appear or takes an excessive amount of time to load. The solution simplifies the wallet detection process by bypassing expensive availability checks for external wallet providers and only performing detection when users actually attempt to connect.

## Glossary

- **Wallet Selection Modal**: The UI component that displays available wallet providers for user selection
- **Mock Wallet Provider**: A testing wallet provider that is always available in development environments
- **Lazy Wallet Detection**: The process of checking wallet availability only when connection is attempted
- **Static Provider Display**: Showing wallet providers without pre-checking their availability status

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the wallet selection modal to appear immediately when I click "Connect Wallet", so that I don't experience delays or think the application is unresponsive.

2. THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL display all wallet providers immediately without performing availability checks
3. THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL show static provider information and installation links for all providers
4. THE Mock Wallet Provider SHALL be marked as "Ready" immediately in development environments
5. THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL not perform any blocking operations during initial display

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see all wallet options immediately, so that I can choose my preferred wallet without waiting for detection processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. THE Static Provider Display SHALL show each provider with name, icon, description, and install button
3. THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL not show "Checking..." or loading states for provider availability
4. WHEN in development mode, THE Mock Wallet Provider SHALL be displayed as the first option with "Ready" status
5. THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL provide install links for all wallet providers regardless of detection status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want wallet detection to happen only when I try to connect, so that the selection process is fast and I get immediate feedback about actual connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lazy Wallet Detection SHALL only check wallet availability when a user clicks on a specific provider
2. WHEN a user clicks on a wallet provider, THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL show a loading state for that specific provider
3. THE Lazy Wallet Detection SHALL perform the availability check and connection attempt in a single operation
4. WHEN wallet detection fails, THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL show specific error messages with installation guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want clear guidance when a wallet is not available, so that I know exactly what to do to resolve the issue.

5. THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL allow users to retry connection attempts without closing the modal

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mock wallet to work immediately for testing, so that development and testing workflows are not impacted by wallet detection issues.
