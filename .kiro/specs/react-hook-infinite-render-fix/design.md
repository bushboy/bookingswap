# Design Document

## Overview

The `useOptimizedProposalData` hook is causing infinite re-render loops due to unstable dependencies in useEffect hooks and callback functions that are recreated on every render. This design addresses the root causes by implementing proper memoization patterns, stabilizing function references, and restructuring the hook's internal logic to prevent cascading re-renders.

## Architecture

### Current Problems Identified

1. **Unstable loadProposals callback**: The `loadProposals` function includes `state.proposals` in its dependency array, but `state.proposals` changes every time the function runs, creating a cycle
2. **Recreated objects in dependencies**: Objects and arrays passed to useEffect are recreated on every render
3. **Cascading useEffect triggers**: Multiple useEffect hooks depend on functions that change, causing chain reactions
4. **Missing memoization**: Critical values and functions lack proper memoization

### Solution Architecture

The fix involves three main architectural changes:

1. **Dependency Stabilization**: Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to create stable references
2. **State Reference Elimination**: Remove state values from callback dependencies where they cause cycles
3. **Effect Isolation**: Separate concerns into independent useEffect hooks with minimal dependencies

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Hook Structure (Unchanged)
```typescript
export function useOptimizedProposalData(
    userId: string | undefined,
    config: OptimizedProposalDataConfig = {}
): OptimizedProposalDataReturn
```

### Internal State Management
- Maintain existing state structure
- Add ref-based tracking for loading states to prevent dependency cycles
- Use functional state updates to avoid stale closures

### Memoization Strategy
- **useCallback**: For all functions returned from the hook and internal callbacks
- **useMemo**: For computed values, cache keys, and configuration objects
- **useRef**: For tracking loading states and preventing concurrent operations

## Data Models

### Stable Dependencies Pattern
```typescript
// Before (unstable)
const loadProposals = useCallback(async () => {
  // Uses state.proposals in logic
}, [userId, finalConfig, cacheKey, state.proposals]); // state.proposals causes cycle

// After (stable)
const loadProposals = useCallback(async () => {
  // Uses functional updates and refs
}, [userId, stableFinalConfig, stableCacheKey]); // Only stable dependencies
```

### Memoized Configuration
```typescript
const stableFinalConfig = useMemo(() => ({ 
  ...DEFAULT_CONFIG, 
  ...config 
}), [
  config.enableCaching,
  config.enableOptimisticUpdates,
  config.enablePreloading,
  config.cacheTimeout,
  config.refreshInterval,
  config.maxRetries
]);
```

## Error Handling

### Existing Error Handling (Preserved)
- Maintain all current error handling logic
- Preserve retry mechanisms and exponential backoff
- Keep error state management unchanged

### Additional Safeguards
- Add guards against concurrent loading operations using refs
- Implement cleanup for abandoned operations
- Maintain error boundaries for hook failures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Focus
- Test that useEffect hooks only trigger when dependencies actually change
- Verify that callback functions maintain stable references
- Ensure state updates don't cause infinite loops
- Test that functionality remains unchanged after optimization

### Integration Testing
- Verify SwapsPage loads without infinite render warnings
- Test real-time updates don't trigger render loops
- Ensure caching and data loading work as expected
- Validate performance improvements

### Performance Testing
- Measure render count reduction
- Verify elimination of "Maximum update depth exceeded" warnings
- Test memory usage improvements from reduced re-renders

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Dependency Stabilization
1. Identify all unstable dependencies in useEffect hooks
2. Apply proper memoization to configuration objects
3. Stabilize cache key generation
4. Remove state values from callback dependencies where they cause cycles

### Phase 2: Callback Optimization
1. Wrap all internal functions with useCallback
2. Use functional state updates to avoid stale closures
3. Replace state dependencies with ref-based tracking
4. Ensure returned functions have stable references

### Phase 3: Effect Isolation
1. Separate initialization effects from update effects
2. Minimize dependencies for each useEffect
3. Use cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks
4. Add guards against concurrent operations

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Test in SwapsPage to ensure infinite render warnings are eliminated
2. Verify all existing functionality works correctly
3. Validate performance improvements
4. Ensure hook works consistently across different usage contexts

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Use Refs for Loading State Tracking
**Rationale**: Refs don't trigger re-renders when updated, breaking the cycle where loading state changes cause effect re-runs.

### Decision 2: Functional State Updates
**Rationale**: Using `setState(prev => ...)` instead of `setState(value)` eliminates the need to include current state in dependencies.

### Decision 3: Granular Dependency Memoization
**Rationale**: Instead of memoizing entire config objects, memoize individual properties to ensure effects only run when specific values change.

### Decision 4: Preserve All Existing Functionality
**Rationale**: This is a performance optimization, not a feature change. All existing behavior must be maintained.

## Performance Considerations

### Expected Improvements
- Elimination of infinite render loops
- Reduced CPU usage from unnecessary re-renders
- Improved memory efficiency
- Faster page load times for SwapsPage

### Monitoring Points
- React DevTools Profiler to measure render count reduction
- Browser console for elimination of warning messages
- User experience improvements in page responsiveness
