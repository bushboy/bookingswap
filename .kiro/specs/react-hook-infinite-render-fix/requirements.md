# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical React infinite re-render issue in the `useOptimizedProposalData` hook that is causing maximum update depth exceeded errors in the SwapsPage component. The hook has unstable dependencies and callback functions that change on every render, triggering endless useEffect cycles.

## Glossary

- **Hook**: A React function that allows components to use state and lifecycle features
- **useEffect**: React hook for performing side effects in functional components
- **Dependency Array**: Array of values that useEffect monitors for changes
- **Infinite Render Loop**: When a component continuously re-renders due to changing dependencies
- **Memoization**: React optimization technique to prevent unnecessary re-computations
- **Stable Reference**: A function or object reference that doesn't change between renders

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the useOptimizedProposalData hook to have stable dependencies, so that it doesn't cause infinite re-render loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the useOptimizedProposalData hook is used, THE Hook SHALL maintain stable function references across renders
2. WHEN useEffect dependencies are evaluated, THE Hook SHALL only trigger effects when actual data changes occur
3. WHEN callback functions are created, THE Hook SHALL use proper memoization to prevent reference changes
4. WHEN the hook is mounted, THE Hook SHALL not trigger more than one initial data load
5. WHEN state updates occur, THE Hook SHALL not cause cascading re-renders

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want useEffect dependencies to be properly memoized, so that effects only run when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect hooks are defined, THE Hook SHALL include only stable dependencies in dependency arrays
2. WHEN objects or arrays are used as dependencies, THE Hook SHALL use useMemo to stabilize their references
3. WHEN callback functions are used as dependencies, THE Hook SHALL use useCallback to prevent recreation
4. WHEN primitive values change, THE Hook SHALL only trigger effects for meaningful changes
5. WHEN the component re-renders, THE Hook SHALL not recreate dependency values unnecessarily

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the SwapsPage to load without infinite render warnings, so that I can view my proposals without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SwapsPage component mounts, THE System SHALL load proposal data without triggering infinite renders
2. WHEN proposal data is refreshed, THE System SHALL complete the operation without render loops
3. WHEN real-time updates are received, THE System SHALL update the UI without causing re-render cycles
4. WHEN the browser console is checked, THE System SHALL not display "Maximum update depth exceeded" warnings
5. WHEN the page is used normally, THE System SHALL maintain responsive performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the hook to maintain its existing functionality, so that proposal data loading and caching continue to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN proposals are loaded, THE Hook SHALL return the same data structure as before
2. WHEN caching is enabled, THE Hook SHALL continue to cache and retrieve proposal data
3. WHEN real-time updates are received, THE Hook SHALL process them correctly
4. WHEN error handling is needed, THE Hook SHALL maintain existing error handling behavior
5. WHEN the hook is used in different components, THE Hook SHALL work consistently across all usage contexts
