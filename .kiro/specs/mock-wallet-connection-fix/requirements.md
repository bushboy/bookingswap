# Mock Wallet Connection Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The mock wallet provider is no longer connecting properly in the development environment. This feature is critical for development and testing workflows as it allows developers to test wallet functionality without installing actual wallet extensions. The mock wallet should be available and functional in development mode and when explicitly enabled via environment variables.

## Glossary

- **Mock_Wallet**: A simulated wallet provider that mimics real wallet behavior for testing and development purposes
- **Wallet_Service**: The central service that manages wallet provider registration and connections
- **Provider_Registration**: The process of making a wallet provider available for connection
- **Development_Environment**: The local development setup where `import.meta.env.DEV` is true
- **Environment_Variable**: Configuration values set via VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_WALLET

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mock wallet to be available in development mode, so that I can test wallet functionality without installing browser extensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development mode, THE Mock_Wallet SHALL be registered with the Wallet_Service
2. WHEN VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_WALLET environment variable is set to 'true', THE Mock_Wallet SHALL be registered regardless of environment
3. THE Mock_Wallet SHALL appear in the wallet selection modal with "Ready for testing" status
4. WHEN a developer clicks on the Mock_Wallet option, THE Mock_Wallet SHALL initiate connection process
5. THE Mock_Wallet SHALL complete connection within 500 milliseconds for development efficiency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mock wallet connection to work reliably, so that I can test wallet-dependent features consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Mock_Wallet connection is initiated, THE Mock_Wallet SHALL successfully establish connection with 90% success rate
2. WHEN Mock_Wallet connection succeeds, THE Mock_Wallet SHALL provide valid account information including account ID and balance
3. WHEN Mock_Wallet connection fails, THE Mock_Wallet SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging
4. THE Mock_Wallet SHALL persist connection state during development session
5. WHEN Mock_Wallet is connected, THE Mock_Wallet SHALL respond to balance and account info requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to debug mock wallet issues easily, so that I can identify and resolve connection problems quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Mock_Wallet registration occurs, THE Wallet_Service SHALL log registration status to console
2. WHEN Mock_Wallet connection is attempted, THE Mock_Wallet SHALL log connection attempts and results
3. IF Mock_Wallet registration fails, THE Wallet_Service SHALL log detailed error information
4. THE Mock_Wallet SHALL provide diagnostic information about its availability status
5. WHEN environment variables are checked, THE application SHALL log Mock_Wallet enablement status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mock wallet to integrate seamlessly with the existing wallet infrastructure, so that it behaves consistently with real wallets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Mock_Wallet SHALL implement the same interface as production wallet providers
2. WHEN Mock_Wallet is connected, THE wallet state management SHALL update correctly
3. THE Mock_Wallet SHALL emit the same events as production wallets (connect, disconnect, accountChanged)
4. WHEN Mock_Wallet is disconnected, THE wallet state SHALL reset properly
5. THE Mock_Wallet SHALL support the same operations as production wallets (getBalance, getAccountInfo)
