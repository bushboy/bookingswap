# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the service recovery initialization failure by implementing proper initialization sequencing and error handling. The core issue is that `serviceRecoveryManager.startRecovery()` is being called before the manager is properly initialized, causing the startup error. The solution involves adding proper initialization calls and error handling to ensure the service recovery system starts correctly.

## Architecture

The fix involves modifying the server startup sequence in `apps/backend/src/index.ts` to:

1. Import the ServiceRecoveryManager
2. Initialize the manager before registering services
3. Register fallback services after initialization
4. Start recovery monitoring only after successful initialization
5. Add proper error handling and cleanup

## Components and Interfaces

### Modified Components

#### 1. Server Startup Sequence (`apps/backend/src/index.ts`)
- **Current Issue**: Calls `startRecovery()` without initialization
- **Solution**: Add `await serviceRecoveryManager.initialize()` before service registration
- **Error Handling**: Wrap initialization in try-catch with graceful degradation

#### 2. ServiceRecoveryManager Initialization
- **Current State**: Has `initialize()` method but it's not being called
- **Enhancement**: Ensure initialization is idempotent and properly validates setup
- **Validation**: Add checks to ensure initialization completed before allowing method calls

### Initialization Flow

```
1. Server Startup
   ↓
2. Import ServiceRecoveryManager
   ↓
3. Initialize ServiceRecoveryManager
   ↓
4. Register Fallback Services
   ↓
5. Start Recovery Monitoring
   ↓
6. Continue Server Startup
```

## Data Models

### Initialization State Tracking
```typescript
interface InitializationState {
  isInitialized: boolean;
  initializationError?: Error;
  initializationTimestamp?: Date;
}
```

### Error Context
```typescript
interface ServiceRecoveryError {
  phase: 'initialization' | 'registration' | 'startup';
  serviceName?: string;
  error: Error;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Initialization Errors
- **Graceful Degradation**: If service recovery fails to initialize, log error but continue server startup
- **Detailed Logging**: Provide specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- **Recovery Options**: Allow manual recovery through monitoring endpoints

### Runtime Error Handling
- **Method Guards**: Ensure methods check initialization state before execution
- **Fallback Behavior**: If recovery system is unavailable, services should still function
- **Error Propagation**: Critical errors should be logged but not crash the server

### Shutdown Handling
- **Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup of recovery monitoring on server shutdown
- **Resource Management**: Stop all timers and clear service registrations
- **Graceful Termination**: Allow ongoing recovery operations to complete

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test initialization sequence with various configurations
- Test error handling for initialization failures
- Test method guards for uninitialized manager

### Integration Tests
- Test full server startup sequence with service recovery
- Test graceful degradation when recovery system fails
- Test proper cleanup on server shutdown

### Error Scenario Tests
- Test behavior when AutomatedServiceRecovery fails to initialize
- Test behavior when fallback services fail to register
- Test recovery from partial initialization failures

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Fix Immediate Startup Issue
1. Add proper initialization call in server startup
2. Add error handling around initialization
3. Ensure startRecovery() is only called after successful initialization

### Phase 2: Enhance Error Handling
1. Add initialization state validation to ServiceRecoveryManager methods
2. Improve error messages and logging
3. Add graceful degradation for initialization failures

### Phase 3: Improve Robustness
1. Add retry logic for initialization failures
2. Add health checks for the recovery system itself
3. Add monitoring endpoints for initialization status
