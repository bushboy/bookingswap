# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The booking-swap-backend service is failing to start due to an error where `serviceRecoveryManager.startRecovery is not a function`. Analysis shows that the ServiceRecoveryManager class has the method, but the service is not being properly initialized before attempting to start recovery monitoring. This feature will ensure proper initialization sequence and error handling for the service recovery system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service recovery system to initialize properly on server startup, so that the backend service can start without errors and provide reliable service monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the ServiceRecoveryManager SHALL be properly initialized before any recovery methods are called
2. WHEN ServiceRecoveryManager initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and handle the failure gracefully
3. WHEN the initialization is successful THEN the system SHALL proceed to start recovery monitoring with the configured interval

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling and logging for service recovery initialization, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix any startup issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ServiceRecoveryManager initialization encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including the specific failure reason
2. WHEN the server shuts down THEN the ServiceRecoveryManager SHALL be properly cleaned up and stopped
3. WHEN initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages for troubleshooting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the service recovery system to have proper startup validation, so that I can be confident the monitoring system is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ServiceRecoveryManager starts THEN it SHALL perform initial health checks on registered services
2. WHEN fallback services are registered THEN they SHALL be validated during initialization
3. WHEN the recovery monitoring starts THEN it SHALL confirm successful activation with appropriate logging
