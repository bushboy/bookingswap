# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix server startup initialization sequence





  - Modify the server startup code in `apps/backend/src/index.ts` to properly initialize ServiceRecoveryManager before calling startRecovery()
  - Add proper error handling around the initialization process
  - Ensure initialization is awaited before proceeding with service registration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Add initialization state validation to ServiceRecoveryManager





  - Add guards to ServiceRecoveryManager methods to ensure initialization has completed
  - Implement proper error messages when methods are called before initialization
  - Add initialization state tracking to prevent duplicate initialization calls
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [ ]* 2.1 Write unit tests for initialization validation
  - Create tests for method guards and initialization state tracking
  - Test error handling for uninitialized manager method calls
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Enhance error handling and logging





  - Improve error messages in ServiceRecoveryManager initialization
  - Add detailed logging for initialization phases and failures
  - Implement graceful degradation when recovery system fails to initialize
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Add proper shutdown handling





  - Ensure ServiceRecoveryManager is properly stopped during server shutdown
  - Add cleanup logic for initialization resources
  - Verify shutdown sequence handles both initialized and uninitialized states
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ]* 4.1 Write integration tests for startup and shutdown
  - Test complete server startup sequence with service recovery
  - Test graceful shutdown with proper cleanup
  - Test error scenarios during initialization
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.2_
