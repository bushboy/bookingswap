# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to accept or reject swap proposals they have received. When a proposal is accepted or rejected, the outcome is recorded in both the database and blockchain for transparency and immutability. For financial proposals involving cash payments, the system automatically transfers funds from the escrow account to the booking holder upon acceptance.

## Glossary

- **Swap_Proposal_System**: The system component that manages swap proposal acceptance and rejection
- **Escrow_Account**: A secure account that holds funds during the proposal process
- **Blockchain_Ledger**: The distributed ledger that records all swap transactions
- **Database**: The primary data storage system for application state
- **Booking_Holder**: The user who owns the original booking being proposed for swap
- **Proposer**: The user who made the swap proposal
- **Financial_Proposal**: A swap proposal that involves cash payment in addition to or instead of booking exchange

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Proposal Acceptance Workflow

**User Story:** As a booking holder who has received swap proposals, I want to accept proposals that meet my needs so that I can complete beneficial swap transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking holder views their received proposals THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL display an "Accept" button for each pending proposal
2. WHEN a booking holder clicks "Accept" THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL prompt for confirmation before proceeding
3. WHEN acceptance is confirmed THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL update the proposal status to "accepted" in the Database
4. WHEN the database update succeeds THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL record the acceptance transaction on the Blockchain_Ledger
5. WHEN both database and blockchain updates succeed THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL notify both the Booking_Holder and Proposer of the acceptance

### Requirement 2: Proposal Rejection Workflow

**User Story:** As a booking holder who has received swap proposals, I want to reject proposals that don't meet my needs so that I can maintain control over my booking exchanges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking holder views their received proposals THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL display a "Reject" button for each pending proposal
2. WHEN a booking holder clicks "Reject" THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL allow them to provide an optional rejection reason
3. WHEN rejection is confirmed THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL update the proposal status to "rejected" in the Database
4. WHEN the database update succeeds THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL record the rejection transaction on the Blockchain_Ledger
5. WHEN both database and blockchain updates succeed THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL notify both the Booking_Holder and Proposer of the rejection

### Requirement 3: Financial Proposal Fund Transfer

**User Story:** As a booking holder accepting a financial proposal, I want to receive the promised payment automatically so that I don't have to manually handle fund transfers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Financial_Proposal is accepted THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL identify the associated Escrow_Account
2. WHEN the escrow account is identified THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL calculate the transfer amount from the proposal terms
3. WHEN the transfer amount is calculated THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL initiate a fund transfer from the Escrow_Account to the Booking_Holder's account
4. WHEN the fund transfer is initiated THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL verify the transfer completion before finalizing the acceptance
5. IF the fund transfer fails THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL revert the proposal status and notify both parties of the failure

### Requirement 4: Database Transaction Integrity

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all proposal acceptance/rejection operations to maintain data integrity so that the system state remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing acceptance or rejection THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL use database transactions to ensure atomicity
2. WHEN updating proposal status THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL also update related swap and booking records in the same transaction
3. WHEN a database operation fails THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL roll back all changes and maintain the original state
4. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL handle race conditions using appropriate locking mechanisms
5. WHEN the operation completes THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL ensure all related entities reflect the new state consistently

### Requirement 5: Blockchain Transaction Recording

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want all proposal outcomes recorded on the blockchain so that there is an immutable record of all swap decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a proposal is accepted or rejected THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL create a blockchain transaction with the outcome details
2. WHEN creating blockchain transactions THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL include proposal ID, outcome, timestamp, and participant addresses
3. WHEN the blockchain transaction is submitted THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL wait for confirmation before considering the operation complete
4. IF the blockchain transaction fails THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL retry up to 3 times before failing the entire operation
5. WHEN blockchain recording succeeds THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL store the transaction hash in the Database for reference

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully so that failed operations don't leave the system in an inconsistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any step in the acceptance/rejection process fails THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL automatically roll back any partial changes
3. WHEN blockchain operations fail THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL revert database changes and notify the user
4. WHEN fund transfer operations fail THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL cancel the acceptance and restore the original proposal state
5. IF system errors occur THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL log detailed error information for debugging and support

### Requirement 7: Notification and Communication

**User Story:** As a platform user involved in swap proposals, I want to receive timely notifications about proposal outcomes so that I can take appropriate next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a proposal is accepted THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL send immediate notifications to both the Booking_Holder and Proposer
2. WHEN a proposal is rejected THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL notify both parties with the rejection reason if provided
3. WHEN fund transfers occur THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL notify the recipient of the successful payment
4. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL notify the initiating user with specific error details
5. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the Swap_Proposal_System SHALL use the user's preferred communication channels (email, in-app, SMS)
