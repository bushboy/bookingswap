# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical code quality issues where duplicate class methods exist in the codebase, specifically in the SwapTargetingRepository, SwapTargetingService, and SwapRepository classes. These duplicate methods are causing TypeScript compilation errors and can lead to unpredictable behavior, maintenance issues, and potential runtime conflicts.

The identified duplicate methods include:
- `getPaginatedTargetingData` in SwapTargetingRepository (lines 786 and another location)
- `getTargetingCounts` in SwapTargetingRepository (lines 917 and another location)  
- `getTargetingHistory` in SwapTargetingService (line 945 and another location)
- `createEnhancedSwap` in SwapRepository (lines 341 and 3570)

The goal is to clean up these duplicate methods while preserving the intended functionality and ensuring no breaking changes to dependent code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate class methods to be removed from the codebase, so that TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the system SHALL not report any duplicate class member errors
2. WHEN examining class definitions THEN each method SHALL appear only once per class
3. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN all duplicate method definitions SHALL be removed
4. IF methods have different implementations THEN the system SHALL preserve the most complete and correct version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that removing duplicate methods doesn't break existing functionality, so that the application continues to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate methods are removed THEN all existing method calls SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN the cleanup is applied THEN all tests SHALL continue to pass
3. WHEN methods are consolidated THEN the preserved implementation SHALL handle all use cases from both duplicates
4. IF there are differences between duplicate implementations THEN the system SHALL merge the functionality appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the method consolidation to follow consistent patterns, so that the codebase maintains good architectural practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating duplicate methods THEN the system SHALL follow existing code patterns and conventions
2. WHEN choosing which implementation to keep THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent, complete, and well-tested version
3. WHEN method signatures differ THEN the system SHALL use the most comprehensive signature that supports all use cases
4. IF method documentation exists THEN the system SHALL preserve or merge the documentation appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prevent future duplicate method issues, so that code quality remains high.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have clear method organization within each class
2. WHEN reviewing the cleaned code THEN method purposes and responsibilities SHALL be clearly defined
3. WHEN similar functionality exists THEN methods SHALL be properly differentiated or consolidated
4. IF there are opportunities for refactoring THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements to prevent future duplication
