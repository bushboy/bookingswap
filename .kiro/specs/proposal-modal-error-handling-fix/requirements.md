# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical runtime error in the MakeProposalModal component where the application crashes when trying to access the `length` property of undefined `recommendations` array in compatibility analysis data. The error occurs at line 1087 when `compatibilityAnalysis.recommendations` is undefined, causing a TypeError that breaks the user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user opening the MakeProposalModal, I want the component to handle missing or incomplete compatibility analysis data gracefully, so that I can continue using the modal without encountering JavaScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compatibilityAnalysis is defined but recommendations is undefined THEN the system SHALL not attempt to access recommendations.length
2. WHEN compatibilityAnalysis.recommendations is null or undefined THEN the system SHALL treat it as an empty array for length checks
3. WHEN any property in compatibilityAnalysis is missing THEN the system SHALL provide safe fallback values
4. WHEN the compatibility analysis data is malformed THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue rendering without crashing
5. WHEN recommendations data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL hide the recommendations section gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive null/undefined checks throughout the MakeProposalModal component, so that similar errors are prevented in other parts of the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any nested property in API response objects THEN the system SHALL use safe navigation or null checks
2. WHEN iterating over arrays from API responses THEN the system SHALL verify the array exists and is valid before mapping
3. WHEN displaying data-dependent UI elements THEN the system SHALL check for data availability before rendering
4. WHEN compatibility analysis fails to load THEN the system SHALL handle the undefined state without breaking other functionality
5. WHEN any API response property is missing THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see helpful error messages or loading states when compatibility data is unavailable, so that I understand what's happening with the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compatibility analysis is loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator in place of recommendations
2. WHEN compatibility analysis fails to load THEN the system SHALL show a subtle error message or hide the section
3. WHEN recommendations are empty THEN the system SHALL either hide the section or show "No recommendations available"
4. WHEN compatibility data is partially available THEN the system SHALL display what's available and handle missing parts gracefully
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging while showing user-friendly messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want consistent error handling patterns throughout the MakeProposalModal, so that future API changes don't break the component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new API data dependencies THEN the system SHALL follow established null-checking patterns
2. WHEN API response structure changes THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle missing or renamed properties
3. WHEN new compatibility features are added THEN the system SHALL include proper error boundaries and fallbacks
4. WHEN debugging errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear console logs with context about what data was expected vs received
5. WHEN testing the component THEN the system SHALL handle all undefined/null scenarios without throwing unhandled exceptions
