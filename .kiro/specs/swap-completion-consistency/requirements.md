# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that when a user accepts a swap proposal, all related entities (swap targets, bookings, and proposals) are consistently updated to their appropriate completed states. The system must maintain data integrity across all related records to prevent inconsistent states where a swap is marked as accepted but related bookings remain in their original status.

## Glossary

- **Swap_Completion_System**: The system component that manages the completion workflow when swaps are accepted
- **Source_Swap**: The original swap that received and accepted a proposal
- **Target_Swap**: The swap that was proposed as part of a booking exchange proposal
- **Source_Booking**: The booking associated with the source swap
- **Target_Booking**: The booking associated with the target swap (in booking exchange scenarios)
- **Swap_Proposal**: A proposal made to exchange bookings or provide cash payment
- **Completion_Transaction**: An atomic database transaction that updates all related entities

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Atomic Swap Completion Workflow

**User Story:** As a booking holder who accepts a swap proposal, I want all related swaps and bookings to be updated consistently so that the system reflects the completed exchange accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a swap proposal is accepted THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL update the Source_Swap status to "completed" in a single transaction
2. WHEN the Source_Swap is updated THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL update the associated Source_Booking status to "swapped" in the same transaction
3. WHEN the proposal involves a Target_Swap THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL update the Target_Swap status to "completed" in the same transaction
4. WHEN the Target_Swap is updated THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL update the associated Target_Booking status to "swapped" in the same transaction
5. WHEN all entity updates succeed THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL update the Swap_Proposal status to "accepted"

### Requirement 2: Booking Exchange Completion

**User Story:** As a platform user involved in a booking exchange, I want both bookings to reflect the completed swap so that I can see the accurate status of my exchanged bookings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking exchange proposal is accepted THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL identify both Source_Booking and Target_Booking
2. WHEN both bookings are identified THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL update both booking statuses to "swapped" atomically
3. WHEN booking statuses are updated THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL record the swap completion timestamp on both bookings
4. WHEN the swap involves ownership transfer THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL update booking ownership records appropriately
5. WHEN all booking updates complete THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL ensure both users can see their new booking status

### Requirement 3: Cash Payment Completion

**User Story:** As a booking holder who accepts a cash payment proposal, I want my booking status to reflect the completed transaction so that the booking is no longer available for other swaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cash payment proposal is accepted THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL update the Source_Booking status to "swapped"
2. WHEN the booking status is updated THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL record the cash payment completion details
3. WHEN payment processing completes THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL ensure the booking is removed from available swap listings
4. WHEN the cash swap completes THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL update the Source_Swap status to "completed"
5. WHEN all updates succeed THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL notify both parties of the completed transaction

### Requirement 4: Transaction Rollback and Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want failed swap completions to be rolled back completely so that the system never ends up in an inconsistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any step in the completion process fails THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL roll back all previous changes in the same transaction
2. WHEN a rollback occurs THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL restore all entities to their original states
3. WHEN rollback completes THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL log the failure details for debugging
4. WHEN the system recovers from failure THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL allow the user to retry the acceptance operation
5. IF multiple failures occur THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL prevent further attempts until manual intervention

### Requirement 5: Completion Status Validation

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the system to validate that all related entities are properly completed so that I can trust the swap status information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a swap completion is processed THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL validate that all related swaps have "completed" status
2. WHEN swap statuses are validated THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL verify that all related bookings have "swapped" status
3. WHEN status validation fails THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL identify and report the inconsistent entities
4. WHEN inconsistencies are detected THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL attempt automatic correction within the same transaction
5. IF automatic correction fails THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL flag the records for manual review

### Requirement 6: Completion Timeline Tracking

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to see accurate completion timestamps for all my swaps and bookings so that I can track when exchanges were finalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a swap is completed THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL record the completion timestamp on the Source_Swap
2. WHEN a Target_Swap exists THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL record the same completion timestamp on the Target_Swap
3. WHEN bookings are updated THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL record the swap completion timestamp on both Source_Booking and Target_Booking
4. WHEN timestamps are recorded THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL ensure all timestamps are identical across related entities
5. WHEN completion tracking is finished THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL make the timeline information available through the API

### Requirement 7: Blockchain Consistency

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the blockchain records to reflect the completed swap status so that there is an immutable record of the finalized exchange.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN swap completion is processed THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL record the completion transaction on the blockchain
2. WHEN blockchain recording succeeds THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL update all related entities with the blockchain transaction ID
3. WHEN multiple entities are involved THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL use a single blockchain transaction for all completion records
4. WHEN blockchain recording fails THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL retry up to 3 times before failing the entire completion
5. IF blockchain recording ultimately fails THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL roll back all database changes and notify the user

### Requirement 8: Notification Consistency

**User Story:** As a platform user involved in a completed swap, I want to receive notifications that accurately reflect all the changes made to my swaps and bookings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN swap completion succeeds THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL send completion notifications to all involved users
2. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL include details of all updated swaps and bookings
3. WHEN booking exchanges occur THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL notify users about their new booking ownership
4. WHEN cash payments are involved THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL include payment confirmation details in notifications
5. WHEN all notifications are sent THEN the Swap_Completion_System SHALL mark the completion workflow as fully finished
