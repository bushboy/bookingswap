# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with the wallet selection modal including failure to appear when users click "Connect Wallet", Redux state serialization errors, and "Cannot connect wallet at this time" errors that prevent successful wallet connections. The system needs to ensure reliable modal display functionality, proper state management, and robust error handling.

## Glossary

- **Wallet Selection Modal**: The UI component that displays available wallet providers for user selection
- **Modal Display System**: The component responsible for controlling modal visibility and rendering
- **Connect Wallet Button**: The UI element that triggers the wallet selection modal
- **Modal State Management**: The system that manages modal open/close states and prevents conflicts
- **Redux State Serialization**: The requirement that all Redux state values must be serializable for proper state management
- **Wallet Connection Validation**: The system that determines when wallet connections are allowed based on current state

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the wallet selection modal to appear immediately when I click "Connect Wallet", so that I can proceed with connecting my wallet without delays or confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Connect Wallet" button, THE Modal Display System SHALL show the wallet selection modal within 200 milliseconds
2. THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL be visible and interactive when displayed
3. THE Modal Display System SHALL ensure the modal appears above all other UI elements with proper z-index layering
4. THE Connect Wallet Button SHALL be disabled during modal display to prevent multiple modal instances
5. THE Modal Display System SHALL handle rapid successive clicks gracefully without creating duplicate modals

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want consistent modal behavior across different browsers and devices, so that I can reliably access wallet connection functionality regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Modal Display System SHALL render the wallet selection modal consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
2. THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL be responsive and properly sized on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
3. THE Modal Display System SHALL handle viewport changes and orientation switches without breaking modal display
4. THE Wallet Selection Modal SHALL maintain proper focus management and keyboard accessibility
5. THE Modal Display System SHALL work correctly with browser zoom levels from 50% to 200%

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want clear visual feedback when the wallet modal fails to appear, so that I understand there is an issue and know how to resolve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal fails to display, THE Modal Display System SHALL show an error message indicating the modal display failure
2. THE Modal Display System SHALL provide a "Retry" button when modal display fails
3. WHEN modal display fails repeatedly, THE Modal Display System SHALL offer alternative connection methods or troubleshooting guidance
4. THE Modal Display System SHALL log detailed error information for debugging modal display issues
5. THE Modal Display System SHALL detect and report conflicts with other modals or overlays

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust modal state management that prevents conflicts and ensures reliable modal display, so that users have a consistent wallet connection experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Modal State Management SHALL prevent multiple wallet modals from being open simultaneously
2. THE Modal State Management SHALL properly clean up modal state when components unmount
3. THE Modal Display System SHALL handle React strict mode and development hot reloading without breaking modal functionality
4. THE Modal State Management SHALL synchronize modal state across multiple instances of the wallet connect button
5. THE Modal Display System SHALL provide debugging hooks and state inspection capabilities for development

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the modal to close properly when I'm done with it, so that I can continue using the application without modal-related interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks outside the modal, THE Modal Display System SHALL close the wallet selection modal
2. WHEN a user presses the Escape key, THE Modal Display System SHALL close the wallet selection modal
3. WHEN a user clicks the close button, THE Modal Display System SHALL close the wallet selection modal immediately
4. THE Modal Display System SHALL restore focus to the Connect Wallet button when the modal closes
5. THE Modal State Management SHALL properly reset all modal-related state when the modal closes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Redux state management that prevents serialization warnings and ensures reliable wallet state, so that the wallet system functions correctly without console errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Redux State Serialization SHALL ensure all state values are serializable by converting Date objects to ISO strings or timestamps
2. THE Modal State Management SHALL store only serializable data in Redux state
3. THE Wallet Connection Validation SHALL properly initialize and maintain connection state without serialization conflicts
4. THE Modal Display System SHALL handle state updates without triggering Redux serialization warnings
5. THE Redux State Serialization SHALL provide proper serialization/deserialization for complex state objects

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the wallet connection process to work reliably without "Cannot connect wallet at this time" errors, so that I can successfully connect my wallet when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Wallet Connection Validation SHALL properly determine when wallet connections are allowed based on current state
2. THE Modal Display System SHALL ensure wallet service is properly initialized before allowing connection attempts
3. THE Wallet Connection Validation SHALL handle edge cases where connection state is temporarily inconsistent
4. THE Modal Display System SHALL provide clear error messages when connections are temporarily unavailable
5. THE Wallet Connection Validation SHALL automatically retry connection validation when state changes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for modal display issues, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix modal-related problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Modal Display System SHALL log all modal state changes with timestamps and context information
2. THE Modal Display System SHALL capture and report JavaScript errors that prevent modal display
3. THE Modal Display System SHALL detect and report CSS conflicts that might affect modal visibility
4. THE Modal Display System SHALL provide performance metrics for modal display timing
5. THE Modal Display System SHALL include browser and device information in error reports for debugging
