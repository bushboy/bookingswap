# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a booking provider dropdown field in both booking creation and edit forms. The dropdown should provide users with a list of popular booking providers while also allowing custom provider entry through an "Other" option. This enhancement improves user experience by standardizing provider names and reducing data entry errors.

## Glossary

- **Booking Provider**: The service or platform through which a booking was made (e.g., Booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb)
- **Booking Form**: User interface for creating or editing booking information
- **Dropdown Field**: A select input that presents predefined options to users
- **Custom Provider**: A provider name entered manually when "Other" is selected
- **Provider Validation**: Ensuring provider information is complete and properly formatted
