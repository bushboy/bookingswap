# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive rate limiting resilience and enhanced error handling for the SwapService API client. The system will provide automatic retry mechanisms, exponential backoff, circuit breaker patterns, and intelligent request queuing to handle API rate limits gracefully while maintaining a responsive user experience.

## Glossary

- **SwapService**: The frontend service class that handles all API communications for swap-related operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Server-side mechanism that restricts the number of API requests within a time window
- **Circuit Breaker**: A design pattern that prevents cascading failures by temporarily stopping requests to a failing service
- **Exponential Backoff**: A retry strategy where wait times increase exponentially between retry attempts
- **Request Queue**: A client-side queue that manages pending API requests during rate limiting periods
- **Retry Strategy**: The logic that determines when and how to retry failed requests
- **Error Recovery**: The process of gracefully handling and recovering from API errors

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the swap platform, I want the application to handle API rate limits gracefully so that I don't experience abrupt failures or lost data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API returns a 429 status code, THE SwapService SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. WHILE rate limiting is active, THE SwapService SHALL queue non-critical requests and process them when limits reset
3. IF multiple consecutive rate limit errors occur, THEN THE SwapService SHALL activate circuit breaker protection
4. WHERE retry attempts are made, THE SwapService SHALL respect the Retry-After header from the server
5. THE SwapService SHALL provide user feedback during rate limiting delays without blocking the interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can monitor API health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwapService SHALL log all rate limiting events with timestamps and request context
2. WHEN API errors occur, THE SwapService SHALL categorize errors by type and severity
3. THE SwapService SHALL track retry attempt counts and success rates for monitoring
4. THE SwapService SHALL provide detailed error information for debugging purposes
5. WHERE errors are recoverable, THE SwapService SHALL attempt automatic recovery before failing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user performing critical operations like creating or accepting swaps, I want these actions to be prioritized during rate limiting so that important transactions are not delayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwapService SHALL implement request prioritization with high priority for critical operations
2. WHEN rate limits are active, THE SwapService SHALL process high-priority requests before queued requests
3. THE SwapService SHALL define critical operations as create, accept, reject, and complete swap actions
4. THE SwapService SHALL allow immediate retry for critical operations with shorter backoff periods
5. WHERE queue capacity is exceeded, THE SwapService SHALL drop low-priority requests before high-priority ones

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback about system status so that I understand when delays are due to rate limiting versus other issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwapService SHALL emit status events that components can subscribe to for user feedback
2. WHEN rate limiting is detected, THE SwapService SHALL provide estimated wait times to the user interface
3. THE SwapService SHALL distinguish between rate limiting delays and other error types in user messaging
4. THE SwapService SHALL provide progress indicators for queued requests
5. WHERE circuit breaker is active, THE SwapService SHALL inform users about temporary service unavailability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable rate limiting parameters so that I can tune the system behavior based on API provider limits and user needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwapService SHALL accept configuration for maximum retry attempts per request type
2. THE SwapService SHALL allow configuration of backoff multipliers and maximum delay times
3. THE SwapService SHALL support configuration of circuit breaker thresholds and timeout periods
4. THE SwapService SHALL enable configuration of request queue sizes and priorities
5. WHERE configuration is invalid, THE SwapService SHALL use safe default values and log warnings
