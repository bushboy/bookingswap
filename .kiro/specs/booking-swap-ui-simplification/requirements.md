# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature simplifies the user interface by integrating swap requirements directly into the booking capture process and enabling users to make swap proposals directly from booking listings. Instead of the current multi-step process where users must first create bookings and then separately create swap proposals, users can now specify their swap preferences during booking creation and immediately see swap opportunities when browsing bookings. This streamlined approach reduces friction and makes the platform more intuitive for users who want to create bookings with swap potential or find swap opportunities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Integrated Booking and Swap Creation

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to specify swap preferences when creating a booking so that I can make my booking available for swapping without additional steps.

2. WHEN the swap option is enabled THEN the system SHALL display swap preference fields including payment types (booking exchange only or booking exchange and cash)
3. WHEN cash payments are enabled THEN the system SHALL require minimum acceptable cash amount input
4. WHEN creating a booking with swap enabled THEN the system SHALL allow selection of deal acceptance strategy (first match or auction mode)

6. WHEN a booking is saved with swap preferences THEN the system SHALL automatically create the swap proposal and make it discoverable
7. WHEN swap preferences are specified THEN the system SHALL validate all swap requirements before saving the booking
8. IF swap validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent booking creation until resolved

### Requirement 2: Booking Listings with Integrated Swap Actions

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to see swap opportunities and make proposals directly from booking listings so that I can quickly identify and act on potential swaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria
