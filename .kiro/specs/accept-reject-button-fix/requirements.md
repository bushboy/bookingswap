# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where users are unable to click on Accept/Reject buttons on the swaps screen. The system needs to ensure that proposal action buttons are properly enabled and functional when proposals are in a valid state for user interaction.

## Glossary

- **Proposal_System**: The system component that manages swap proposals and their lifecycle
- **Action_Button**: Interactive UI elements (Accept/Reject buttons) that allow users to respond to proposals
- **Proposal_Status**: The current state of a proposal (pending, accepted, rejected, expired)
- **User_Interface**: The frontend components that display proposals and action buttons
- **Button_State**: The enabled/disabled state of action buttons based on proposal conditions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a swap owner, I want to be able to click Accept/Reject buttons on pending proposals, so that I can respond to incoming swap requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a proposal has status 'pending', THE Proposal_System SHALL enable the Accept and Reject buttons
2. WHEN a proposal has status other than 'pending', THE Proposal_System SHALL hide the Accept and Reject buttons
3. WHEN a proposal is not expired, THE Proposal_System SHALL allow button interactions
4. WHEN a proposal is expired, THE Proposal_System SHALL disable all action buttons
5. WHEN a user clicks an enabled Accept button, THE Proposal_System SHALL process the acceptance action

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a swap owner, I want to see clear visual feedback when buttons are processing my action, so that I know my click was registered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks an Accept or Reject button, THE User_Interface SHALL display a loading state
2. WHILE an action is processing, THE Proposal_System SHALL disable all action buttons for that proposal
3. WHEN an action completes successfully, THE User_Interface SHALL update the proposal status
4. WHEN an action fails, THE User_Interface SHALL display an error message and re-enable the buttons
5. THE User_Interface SHALL provide visual feedback within 200 milliseconds of button click

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a swap owner, I want the system to validate my permissions before showing action buttons, so that I only see buttons for proposals I can actually act upon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current user is the proposal recipient, THE Proposal_System SHALL display action buttons
2. WHEN the current user is not the proposal recipient, THE Proposal_System SHALL hide action buttons
3. WHEN the user lacks necessary permissions, THE Proposal_System SHALL disable action buttons
4. THE Proposal_System SHALL validate user permissions before rendering any action buttons
5. WHEN user permissions change, THE User_Interface SHALL update button visibility accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a swap owner, I want to receive confirmation dialogs for important actions, so that I can avoid accidental accepts or rejects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks Accept button, THE User_Interface SHALL display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN a user clicks Reject button, THE User_Interface SHALL display a confirmation dialog with optional reason field
3. WHEN a user confirms an action, THE Proposal_System SHALL execute the requested action
4. WHEN a user cancels a confirmation dialog, THE User_Interface SHALL return to the previous state
5. THE User_Interface SHALL allow users to disable confirmation dialogs through settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling for button interactions, so that users receive helpful feedback when actions fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a button action fails due to network issues, THE Proposal_System SHALL display a retry option
2. WHEN a button action fails due to invalid state, THE Proposal_System SHALL refresh the proposal data
3. WHEN multiple rapid clicks occur, THE Proposal_System SHALL prevent duplicate action submissions
4. WHEN an action times out, THE Proposal_System SHALL provide clear timeout messaging
5. THE Proposal_System SHALL log all button interaction errors for debugging purposes
