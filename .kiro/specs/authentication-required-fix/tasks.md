# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Remove unnecessary authentication check from ReceivedProposalsSection





  - Remove the `!isAuthenticated && totalProposals > 0` check that shows "Authentication Required" message
  - Remove the authentication prompt UI block that prevents users from seeing proposals
  - Update component logic to assume users are authenticated when they reach the proposals page
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.1_

- [x] 2. Enhance permission validation logic






  - [x] 2.1 Update validateUserPermissions function to remove authentication dependency

    - Remove the `if (!isAuthenticated)` check from the permission validation function
    - Modify the function to focus on user ID availability and proposal permissions only
    - Update the error messages to be more specific about missing user data vs authentication
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.5, 4.3_


  - [x] 2.2 Improve graceful degradation for missing user data

    - Handle cases where `effectiveCurrentUserId` is null without blocking the entire interface
    - Show helpful warning messages when user data is missing instead of authentication errors
    - Provide actionable guidance (like "refresh the page") when user data is unavailable
    - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.5_

- [x] 3. Enhance error handling and user feedback





  - [x] 3.1 Update permission fallback logic


    - Modify `getPermissionFallback` function to provide more specific error messages
    - Distinguish between different types of permission issues (missing user ID, verification level, proposal status)
    - Add actionable guidance for recoverable issues
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1, 3.3_

  - [x] 3.2 Add development mode debugging information


    - Create debug information display for development mode when user data is missing
    - Show current user ID, store user ID, and provided user ID for debugging
    - Add proposal count and permission state information for troubleshooting
    - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 4. Update component dependencies and imports





  - Remove unused `selectIsAuthenticated` import from auth selectors
  - Remove `isAuthenticated` from the component's Redux state dependencies
  - Clean up any authentication-related state variables that are no longer needed
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.5_

- [ ] 5. Test and validate the changes
  - [ ] 5.1 Test component rendering without authentication checks
    - Verify that proposals are displayed correctly when user data is available
    - Test that Accept/Reject buttons appear for pending proposals with proper permissions
    - Confirm that the "Authentication Required" message no longer appears
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 2.2_

  - [ ] 5.2 Test graceful degradation scenarios
    - Test component behavior when `effectiveCurrentUserId` is null
    - Verify that appropriate warning messages are shown instead of blocking the interface
    - Test that the component doesn't crash when user data is missing
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Update logging and debugging
  - [ ] 6.1 Enhance permission validation logging
    - Update console.log statements to focus on permission and proposal status issues
    - Remove authentication-related logging that is no longer relevant
    - Add more detailed logging for permission validation decisions
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

  - [ ] 6.2 Add debug utilities for proposal state inspection
    - Create debug information that helps identify why buttons might be hidden
    - Log proposal status, user permissions, and permission validation results
    - Provide clear debugging information in development mode
    - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5_
