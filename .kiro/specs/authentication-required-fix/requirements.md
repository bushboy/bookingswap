# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where users see "Authentication Required" instead of Accept/Reject buttons on proposals, even though they are already authenticated and viewing their proposals page. The system needs to remove unnecessary authentication checks in proposal components since authentication should be handled at the route level.

## Glossary

- **Proposal_Interface**: The UI components that display proposals and action buttons
- **Route_Protection**: The system that ensures only authenticated users can access protected pages
- **Component_Logic**: The business logic within proposal components that determines button visibility
- **User_Permissions**: The specific permissions a user has to accept or reject proposals
- **Authentication_Check**: Validation of user authentication status within components

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user viewing my proposals page, I want to see Accept/Reject buttons immediately without additional authentication checks, so that I can interact with my proposals efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the proposals page, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL assume the user is authenticated
2. WHEN displaying proposals, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL not perform redundant authentication checks
3. WHEN a proposal is pending, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL show Accept/Reject buttons based on proposal status and permissions only
4. WHEN authentication is required, THE Route_Protection SHALL handle it before the user reaches the proposals page
5. THE Proposal_Interface SHALL focus on proposal-specific logic rather than authentication validation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with pending proposals, I want to see Accept/Reject buttons based only on my permissions and proposal status, so that I can take actions without unnecessary barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a proposal status is 'pending', THE Proposal_Interface SHALL display action buttons if user has permissions
2. WHEN a proposal status is not 'pending', THE Proposal_Interface SHALL hide action buttons and show status message
3. WHEN user lacks permissions for a specific proposal, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL show appropriate permission message
4. WHEN proposal data is loading, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL show loading state without authentication checks
5. THE Proposal_Interface SHALL determine button visibility based on proposal ownership and status only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging proposal button issues, I want clear logging about why buttons are hidden or shown, so that I can quickly identify permission or status-related problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN buttons are hidden, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL log the specific reason (status, permissions, etc.)
2. WHEN rendering proposals, THE Component_Logic SHALL log proposal status and user permission checks
3. WHEN permission validation fails, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL log detailed permission information
4. THE Component_Logic SHALL provide debug utilities to inspect proposal state and permissions
5. WHEN in development mode, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL display proposal debug information without authentication details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing proposals, I want the interface to work correctly regardless of Redux authentication state inconsistencies, so that I can manage my proposals reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redux authentication state is inconsistent, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL still function based on route protection
2. WHEN user data is available, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL use it for permission validation
3. WHEN user data is missing, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL gracefully handle the missing data
4. WHEN authentication state updates, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL not unnecessarily re-render or block functionality
5. THE Component_Logic SHALL be resilient to authentication state inconsistencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proposal components to be decoupled from authentication concerns, so that the system is more maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN proposal components render, THE Component_Logic SHALL not depend on authentication state checks
2. WHEN authentication is required, THE Route_Protection SHALL handle it at the application routing level
3. WHEN user permissions are needed, THE Component_Logic SHALL use user data directly rather than authentication flags
4. WHEN components fail, THE Proposal_Interface SHALL not fail due to authentication-related issues
5. THE Component_Logic SHALL separate concerns between authentication and proposal management
