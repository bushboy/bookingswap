# WebSocket Connection and HTTP API Throttling Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing rapid WebSocket connect/disconnect cycles and excessive HTTP API calls on the /swaps page. This feature adds comprehensive throttling for both WebSocket connections and HTTP API calls to restore normal performance and prevent server overload.

## Glossary

- **WebSocket_Service**: The frontend services managing real-time connections (proposalWebSocketService, completionWebSocketService)
- **HTTP_API_Service**: The frontend services making HTTP requests (swapService, proposalDataService)
- **Connection_Throttling**: Adding delays and rate limiting to connection attempts
- **API_Call_Throttling**: Adding delays and rate limiting to HTTP API requests
- **Redux_Middleware**: The middleware components that handle WebSocket connections based on Redux actions
- **Connection_Debouncing**: Delaying connection attempts to prevent rapid successive calls
- **API_Debouncing**: Delaying API calls to prevent rapid successive requests
- **SwapsPage_Component**: The main page component displaying user swaps and proposals

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to slow down WebSocket connection attempts, so that connection loops are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redux actions trigger connection attempts, THE Redux_Middleware SHALL debounce connection calls with a minimum delay
2. WHEN WebSocket services attempt to connect, THE WebSocket_Service SHALL check if already connected before attempting new connections
3. WHEN connection attempts fail, THE WebSocket_Service SHALL implement delays before retry attempts
4. THE WebSocket_Service SHALL limit connection attempts to a maximum frequency per time window

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want connection state checking, so that duplicate connections are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a connection attempt is made, THE WebSocket_Service SHALL verify current connection status first
2. THE WebSocket_Service SHALL track connection state to prevent duplicate connection attempts
3. WHEN already connected, THE WebSocket_Service SHALL skip new connection attempts
4. THE WebSocket_Service SHALL provide accurate connection status queries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want middleware connection throttling, so that Redux actions don't trigger excessive connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Redux_Middleware SHALL implement connection attempt debouncing with configurable delays
2. THE Redux_Middleware SHALL track recent connection attempts to prevent rapid successive calls
3. WHEN multiple actions trigger connections quickly, THE Redux_Middleware SHALL batch them into single connection attempts
4. THE Redux_Middleware SHALL clear connection attempt tracking after successful connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want HTTP API call throttling on the SwapsPage, so that excessive API requests are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loadSwaps function is called multiple times rapidly, THE SwapsPage_Component SHALL debounce API calls with a minimum delay
2. WHEN user actions trigger proposal refreshes, THE HTTP_API_Service SHALL throttle refresh requests to prevent server overload
3. WHEN real-time updates trigger API calls, THE SwapsPage_Component SHALL batch multiple updates into single API requests
4. THE HTTP_API_Service SHALL implement rate limiting for swap-related API endpoints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proposal data loading throttling, so that the useOptimizedProposalData hook doesn't make excessive API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hook auto-refreshes proposals, THE HTTP_API_Service SHALL respect minimum intervals between API calls
2. WHEN multiple components request proposal data simultaneously, THE HTTP_API_Service SHALL deduplicate identical requests
3. WHEN retry logic is triggered, THE HTTP_API_Service SHALL implement exponential backoff with maximum retry limits
4. THE HTTP_API_Service SHALL cache proposal data to reduce unnecessary API calls

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want user action throttling, so that rapid button clicks don't cause API call storms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users click refresh buttons rapidly, THE SwapsPage_Component SHALL debounce refresh actions with configurable delays
2. WHEN proposal accept/reject actions are triggered, THE HTTP_API_Service SHALL prevent duplicate submissions during processing
3. WHEN targeting actions are performed, THE SwapsPage_Component SHALL throttle targeting API calls to prevent rapid successive requests
4. THE SwapsPage_Component SHALL provide visual feedback during throttled operations to inform users
