# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a secure password recovery system that allows users to reset their forgotten passwords through email verification. The system will provide a user-friendly way for users to regain access to their accounts while maintaining security best practices including rate limiting, secure token generation, and proper email validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has forgotten my password, I want to request a password reset via email, so that I can regain access to my account without contacting support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" on the login page THEN the system SHALL display a password reset request form
2. WHEN a user enters their email address in the password reset form THEN the system SHALL validate the email format
3. WHEN a user submits a valid email address THEN the system SHALL send a password reset email if the email exists in the system
4. WHEN a user submits an invalid or non-existent email THEN the system SHALL display a generic success message to prevent email enumeration attacks
5. WHEN a password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a secure, time-limited token associated with the user account

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a clear and secure password reset email, so that I can easily complete the password reset process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a password reset email is sent THEN the email SHALL contain a secure reset link with a unique token
2. WHEN a password reset email is sent THEN the email SHALL include clear instructions on how to reset the password
3. WHEN a password reset email is sent THEN the email SHALL include an expiration time for the reset link
4. WHEN a password reset email is sent THEN the email SHALL include a warning about not sharing the link
5. WHEN a password reset token is generated THEN it SHALL expire after 1 hour
6. WHEN a password reset token is generated THEN it SHALL be cryptographically secure and unpredictable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set a new password using the reset link, so that I can regain access to my account with a password I remember.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a valid password reset link THEN the system SHALL display a new password form
2. WHEN a user clicks an expired reset link THEN the system SHALL display an error message and option to request a new reset
3. WHEN a user clicks an invalid reset link THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN a user enters a new password THEN the system SHALL validate the password meets security requirements
5. WHEN a user submits a valid new password THEN the system SHALL update the user's password and invalidate the reset token
6. WHEN a password is successfully reset THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page with a success message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the password recovery system to be protected against abuse, so that it cannot be used for spam or denial of service attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password resets THEN the system SHALL limit requests to 3 per email address per hour
2. WHEN a user exceeds the rate limit THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a password reset token is used THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate it to prevent reuse
4. WHEN a new password reset is requested for an account THEN the system SHALL invalidate any existing unused tokens for that account
5. WHEN password reset attempts are made THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be notified when my password is successfully changed, so that I'm aware of any unauthorized access attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a password is successfully reset THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email to the user
2. WHEN a password reset confirmation email is sent THEN it SHALL include the date and time of the change
3. WHEN a password reset confirmation email is sent THEN it SHALL include instructions on what to do if the change was unauthorized
4. WHEN a password is reset THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing user sessions to force re-authentication
