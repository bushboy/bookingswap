# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical runtime error where the `BookingService.getBookingById` method is not available when called by the `SwapProposalService.createEnhancedSwapProposal` method. The error "this.bookingService.getBookingById is not a function" indicates a service dependency injection or method availability issue that prevents enhanced swap creation from functioning properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Service Method Availability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all BookingService methods to be properly available at runtime so that dependent services can function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SwapProposalService calls this.bookingService.getBookingById THEN the system SHALL execute the method successfully
2. WHEN the BookingService is injected into SwapProposalService THEN all public methods SHALL be available
3. IF the getBookingById method is missing THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message indicating the service configuration issue
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that all required service methods are available

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Swap Creation Functionality

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to create enhanced swaps successfully so that I can list my bookings for exchange with advanced features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an enhanced swap THEN the system SHALL validate the source booking exists using BookingService.getBookingById
2. WHEN the enhanced swap creation process starts THEN the system SHALL retrieve booking details without errors
3. IF the booking validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages to the user
4. WHEN the booking is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL proceed with swap creation

### Requirement 3: Service Dependency Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want service dependencies to be properly validated so that runtime errors are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are instantiated THEN the system SHALL verify all required methods exist
2. WHEN a service method is called THEN the system SHALL ensure the method is properly bound to the service instance
3. IF a required method is missing THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages
4. WHEN service injection occurs THEN the system SHALL validate the service interface compatibility

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want clear error messages when swap creation fails so that I can understand what went wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service method is not available THEN the system SHALL return a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN enhanced swap creation fails due to service issues THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. IF the BookingService is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to resolve the issue
4. WHEN service errors occur THEN the system SHALL not crash but handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 5: Service Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests to verify service integration so that method availability issues are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL verify all service method calls work correctly
2. WHEN SwapProposalService is tested THEN the system SHALL mock BookingService with all required methods
3. IF a service method is missing in tests THEN the system SHALL fail the test with clear indication of the missing method
4. WHEN service dependencies change THEN the system SHALL update tests to reflect the new interface requirements
