# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures the SwapExpirationService is properly initialized and started during application startup. The service exists but is not currently being started, which means expired swaps are not being automatically cancelled as intended. This causes users to encounter authorization errors when trying to manually reject expired swaps.

## Glossary

- **SwapExpirationService**: Existing service that automatically cancels expired swaps every 5 minutes
- **Application Startup**: The server initialization process in index.ts
- **Service Lifecycle**: The process of starting and stopping background services during application lifecycle
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of services when the application terminates

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the SwapExpirationService to start automatically when the server starts so that expired swaps are processed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE application startup process SHALL initialize the SwapExpirationService during server startup
2. THE SwapExpirationService SHALL be started after all required dependencies are initialized
3. THE application SHALL log successful initialization of the SwapExpirationService
4. THE SwapExpirationService SHALL use the existing factory method for consistent initialization
5. WHERE initialization fails, THE application SHALL log the error and continue startup with degraded functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the SwapExpirationService to be properly stopped during graceful shutdown so that resources are cleaned up correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE graceful shutdown process SHALL stop the SwapExpirationService before terminating the application
2. THE shutdown process SHALL wait for the SwapExpirationService to complete its current operation before stopping
3. THE application SHALL log successful shutdown of the SwapExpirationService
4. THE shutdown process SHALL handle errors during SwapExpirationService shutdown gracefully
5. WHERE the service fails to stop cleanly, THE application SHALL log the error and continue shutdown

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SwapExpirationService configuration to be consistent with other services so that it follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwapExpirationService SHALL use the same configuration pattern as other background services
2. THE service SHALL use environment variables for configuration where appropriate
3. THE SwapExpirationService SHALL be initialized using the existing factory method
4. THE service initialization SHALL follow the same error handling patterns as other services
5. WHERE configuration is missing, THE service SHALL use safe default values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a monitoring system, I want visibility into the SwapExpirationService status so that I can track its health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwapExpirationService SHALL be included in health check monitoring
2. THE service SHALL provide status information through the existing monitoring endpoints
3. THE application SHALL track SwapExpirationService startup and shutdown events
4. THE service SHALL log periodic status information for monitoring purposes
5. WHERE the service encounters errors, THE monitoring system SHALL be notified

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the swap platform, I want expired swaps to be automatically processed so that I don't encounter errors when interacting with expired swaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwapExpirationService SHALL process expired swaps every 5 minutes as designed
2. THE service SHALL update swap statuses from 'pending' to 'cancelled' for expired swaps
3. THE service SHALL unlock bookings associated with expired swaps
4. THE service SHALL send appropriate notifications when swaps expire
5. WHERE the service is not running, THE system SHALL provide clear error messages to users about expired swap handling
