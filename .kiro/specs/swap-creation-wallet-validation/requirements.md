# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that users must have a connected wallet before they can create swaps in the trading application. The validation prevents users from proceeding with swap creation without proper wallet authentication and provides clear guidance on how to connect their wallet.

## Glossary

- **Swap Creation System**: The application component responsible for creating new swap listings
- **Wallet Connection Service**: The service that manages wallet connectivity and authentication
- **User Interface**: The frontend components that users interact with for swap creation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to check my wallet connection when I click "Create Swap", so that I cannot proceed without proper wallet authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Create Swap" button, THE Swap Creation System SHALL verify wallet connection status before proceeding
2. IF no wallet is connected, THEN THE User Interface SHALL display a clear error message indicating wallet connection is required
3. WHEN a wallet is connected, THE Swap Creation System SHALL allow the user to proceed with swap creation
4. THE User Interface SHALL prevent form submission until wallet connection is established
5. THE Swap Creation System SHALL validate wallet connection in real-time during the creation process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want clear instructions on how to connect my wallet when validation fails, so that I can quickly resolve the issue and create my swap.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wallet validation fails, THE User Interface SHALL display a prominent error message with connection instructions
2. THE User Interface SHALL provide a direct link or button to initiate wallet connection
3. WHEN a user connects their wallet after validation failure, THE Swap Creation System SHALL automatically re-validate and allow proceeding
4. THE User Interface SHALL show the current wallet connection status clearly in the swap creation interface
5. THE User Interface SHALL update the connection status immediately when wallet state changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to validate my wallet has sufficient balance for swap creation, so that I don't encounter transaction failures later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wallet is connected, THE Swap Creation System SHALL check the wallet balance against required amounts
2. THE Swap Creation System SHALL calculate total required funds including transaction fees, escrow amounts, and platform fees
3. IF wallet balance is insufficient, THEN THE User Interface SHALL display detailed breakdown of required funds and current shortfall
4. THE User Interface SHALL show the specific amounts needed for transaction fees, escrow, and platform fees
5. WHEN balance is sufficient, THE Swap Creation System SHALL allow swap creation to proceed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the wallet validation to work consistently across different swap types, so that I have a predictable experience regardless of swap configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Swap Creation System SHALL apply wallet validation for all swap types including booking exchanges and cash-enabled swaps
2. WHEN creating cash-enabled swaps, THE Swap Creation System SHALL validate balance requirements for escrow amounts
3. WHEN creating booking-only swaps, THE Swap Creation System SHALL validate balance for transaction fees only
4. THE Swap Creation System SHALL provide appropriate error messages based on the specific swap type being created
5. THE User Interface SHALL maintain consistent validation behavior across all swap creation flows

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want wallet validation to be implemented both on frontend and backend, so that the system maintains security and data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User Interface SHALL perform wallet validation before allowing form submission
2. THE Swap Creation System SHALL perform server-side wallet validation for all swap creation requests
3. WHEN backend validation fails, THE Swap Creation System SHALL return appropriate error codes and messages
4. THE User Interface SHALL handle backend validation errors gracefully and display user-friendly messages
5. THE Swap Creation System SHALL log validation failures for monitoring and debugging purposes
