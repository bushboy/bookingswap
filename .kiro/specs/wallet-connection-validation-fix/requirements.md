# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical issue where the wallet validation system incorrectly reports "Wallet Validation Failed - Please connect your wallet before creating a swap" even when a wallet appears to be connected. The system needs to properly detect wallet connection states and provide accurate validation feedback to users.

## Glossary

- **Wallet Connection Detection System**: The component responsible for determining if a wallet is properly connected and accessible
- **Validation Service**: The service that orchestrates wallet connection and balance validation
- **Connection State Synchronization**: The process of ensuring UI state matches actual wallet connection status

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to accurately detect my wallet connection status, so that I don't get false "wallet not connected" errors when my wallet is actually connected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wallet is connected through the wallet provider, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL accurately report the connection as active
2. THE Validation Service SHALL verify wallet connection using multiple validation methods to ensure accuracy
3. WHEN wallet connection state changes, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL immediately update the validation status
4. THE Validation Service SHALL distinguish between temporary connection issues and actual disconnection
5. THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL provide detailed logging for connection state debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want consistent wallet connection status across all parts of the application, so that I don't see conflicting information about my wallet state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Connection State Synchronization SHALL ensure wallet status is consistent between UI components and validation services
2. WHEN the wallet service reports a connection, THE Validation Service SHALL use the same connection information
3. THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL use a single source of truth for wallet connection status
4. WHEN connection status updates, THE Connection State Synchronization SHALL propagate changes to all dependent components
5. THE Validation Service SHALL cache connection status appropriately to avoid inconsistent states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want clear diagnostic information when wallet validation fails, so that I can understand and resolve the actual issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wallet validation fails, THE Validation Service SHALL provide specific error details about what validation check failed
2. THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL log detailed connection state information for debugging
3. THE Validation Service SHALL differentiate between connection errors, balance errors, and configuration errors
4. WHEN validation fails, THE Validation Service SHALL provide actionable guidance based on the specific failure type
5. THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL expose connection diagnostics for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust wallet connection validation that handles edge cases and network issues, so that users have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL handle temporary network disconnections gracefully
2. WHEN wallet provider APIs are slow or unresponsive, THE Validation Service SHALL implement appropriate timeouts and retries
3. THE Validation Service SHALL validate wallet connection using both local state and remote verification when possible
4. WHEN connection validation encounters errors, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL provide fallback validation methods
5. THE Validation Service SHALL implement connection health checks to proactively detect issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the wallet validation to work correctly with the existing wallet service implementation, so that I can create swaps without encountering false validation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Validation Service SHALL properly integrate with the existing WalletService getConnection() method
2. WHEN WalletService reports isConnected as true, THE Validation Service SHALL accept this as valid connection state
3. THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL properly parse and validate wallet account information from the service
4. THE Validation Service SHALL handle both mock and production wallet service implementations correctly
5. WHEN wallet service state changes, THE Connection State Synchronization SHALL update validation state accordingly
