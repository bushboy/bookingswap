# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing the connection status indicator from the top menu bar that currently displays "Connected/Disconnected" status. The indicator consistently shows "Disconnected" and provides no useful information to users, creating visual clutter in the navigation area.

## Glossary

- **Connection Status Indicator**: The UI component in the top menu bar that displays connection status text
- **Header Component**: The top navigation bar component containing the logo, navigation links, and user controls
- **Top Menu Bar**: The horizontal navigation area at the top of the application interface

### Requirement 2

3. THE Header Component SHALL NOT import or reference useConnectionStatus hooks
4. THE Header Component SHALL remove all connection status related event handlers and state management
