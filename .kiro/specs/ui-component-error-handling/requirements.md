# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing UI component errors that cause React component tree recreation, particularly in the Badge component used by the ConnectionStatusIndicator. These errors disrupt the user experience and can lead to application instability. This feature addresses UI component reliability by fixing missing design token references, implementing proper error boundaries, and ensuring robust component error handling.

## Glossary

- **Badge_Component**: UI component for displaying status indicators and labels
- **Design_Tokens**: Centralized design system values for colors, spacing, typography
- **Error_Boundary**: React component that catches JavaScript errors in component tree
- **Component_Tree**: Hierarchical structure of React components in the application
- **Connection_Status_Indicator**: Component displaying real-time connection status using Badge

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want UI components to render without errors, so that the application interface remains stable and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Badge component renders, THE Badge_Component SHALL access all required design tokens without errors
2. THE Design_Tokens SHALL include complete color definitions for all Badge variants
3. IF a design token is missing, THEN THE Badge_Component SHALL use fallback values instead of throwing errors
4. THE Badge_Component SHALL validate all prop values before rendering
5. WHEN invalid props are provided, THE Badge_Component SHALL log warnings and use default values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error boundaries around UI components, so that component errors don't crash the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE application SHALL implement Error_Boundary components around critical UI sections
2. WHEN a component error occurs, THE Error_Boundary SHALL catch the error and display fallback UI
3. THE Error_Boundary SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHILE in error state, THE Error_Boundary SHALL provide recovery options for users
5. THE Error_Boundary SHALL prevent error propagation to parent components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want connection status indicators to work reliably, so that I can always see the current connection state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Connection_Status_Indicator SHALL render without causing component tree recreation
2. WHEN connection status changes, THE Connection_Status_Indicator SHALL update smoothly without errors
3. IF the Badge component fails, THEN THE Connection_Status_Indicator SHALL display a text-based fallback
4. THE Connection_Status_Indicator SHALL handle all connection status values gracefully
5. WHEN rendering errors occur, THE Connection_Status_Indicator SHALL maintain basic functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust design system tokens, so that all UI components have consistent styling without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Design_Tokens SHALL include complete color palettes for all component variants
2. THE Design_Tokens SHALL provide fallback values for missing color definitions
3. WHEN accessing design tokens, THE system SHALL validate token existence before usage
4. THE Design_Tokens SHALL include TypeScript types to prevent invalid token access
5. THE Design_Tokens SHALL be validated at build time to catch missing definitions
