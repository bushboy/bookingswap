# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PaymentSecurityService.ts file contains duplicate method definitions that are causing TypeScript compilation errors. The duplicate methods are `validateCreditCardSecurity`, `validateBankTransferSecurity`, and `validateDigitalWalletSecurity`. These duplicates need to be resolved by consolidating the functionality into single, comprehensive method implementations while maintaining all existing security validation capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PaymentSecurityService to compile without duplicate member errors, so that the application can build successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PaymentSecurityService.ts file is compiled THEN there SHALL be no duplicate class member errors
2. WHEN TypeScript linting is run THEN there SHALL be no duplicate-class-member violations
3. WHEN the service is instantiated THEN all methods SHALL be accessible without conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all payment validation functionality to be preserved, so that security checks continue to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credit card validation is performed THEN the system SHALL validate card number format, expiry date, CVV, and card type restrictions
2. WHEN bank transfer validation is performed THEN the system SHALL validate micro-deposits, account numbers, and routing numbers
3. WHEN digital wallet validation is performed THEN the system SHALL validate wallet provider, wallet ID format, and provider-specific requirements
4. WHEN any payment method validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages and security score deductions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the consolidated methods to have consistent signatures and return types, so that all calling code continues to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing code calls payment validation methods THEN the methods SHALL maintain backward compatibility
2. WHEN validation results are returned THEN they SHALL include errors, warnings, and security score information
3. WHEN method signatures are updated THEN all existing callers SHALL continue to work without changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to follow best practices for method organization, so that the service is maintainable and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the consolidated methods THEN each method SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
2. WHEN examining method documentation THEN each method SHALL have comprehensive JSDoc comments
3. WHEN looking at the code structure THEN duplicate logic SHALL be eliminated while preserving all functionality
