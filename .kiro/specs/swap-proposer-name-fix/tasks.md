# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze and fix the JOIN chain in SwapRepository.findSwapCardsWithProposals





  - Examine the current JOIN chain to identify where proposer_name is becoming NULL
  - Add query result validation to detect incomplete JOINs
  - Implement enhanced logging to track JOIN chain failures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_




- [x] 2. Implement robust proposer lookup mechanism in SwapRepository


  - Create getProposerDetails method for separate user lookup
  - Add fallback user identification methods (direct lookup, booking-derived)
  - Implement query result enrichment for missing user data
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Enhance SwapProposalService transformation with user data validation





  - Update transformRowToSwapProposal to validate proposer data before transformation
  - Add proposer data enrichment if primary JOIN data is missing
  - Implement detailed logging when user data cannot be retrieved
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Add comprehensive error handling and diagnostic logging





  - Implement JOIN chain failure detection and logging
  - Add diagnostic information for missing user relationships
  - Create monitoring for proposer lookup success/failure rates
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Write comprehensive tests for proposer name resolution






  - Create unit tests for JOIN chain validation and fallback mechanisms
  - Add integration tests for complete data flow scenarios
  - Test edge cases with missing/corrupted user data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 6. Verify fix resolves "unknown" user display issue





  - Test the complete fix with real swap proposal data
  - Verify that actual user names appear instead of "unknown"
  - Confirm that fallback only occurs when user data truly doesn't exist
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.4_
