# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add comprehensive authentication debugging and logging





  - Add detailed logging to AuthMiddleware to track token extraction, verification, and user lookup steps
  - Create debug utility functions to validate token format and JWT configuration
  - Implement enhanced error responses with specific debug information for troubleshooting
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 2. Create authentication diagnostic tools





  - Build a token validation utility that can decode and analyze JWT tokens without verification
  - Create an authentication health check endpoint to validate system configuration
  - Implement user session diagnostic functions to verify token-user relationships
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Enhance error handling in authentication middleware










  - Improve error categorization and messaging in AuthMiddleware authenticate method
  - Add specific error codes for different failure scenarios (token format, JWT verification, user lookup)
  - Implement structured error responses that include debug information when appropriate
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.4, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Test and validate authentication flow with real tokens







  - Create test script to validate authentication with actual user tokens
  - Test the complete flow from token extraction through user data attachment
  - Verify that getUserSwaps method receives properly authenticated requests
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 2.3_

- [ ]* 4.1 Write comprehensive authentication tests
  - Create unit tests for enhanced AuthMiddleware debugging functions
  - Write integration tests for authentication flow with various token scenarios
  - Add tests for error handling and debug information accuracy
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 5. Implement immediate debugging for current 401 issue





  - Add temporary debug logging to identify where the authentication is failing
  - Create a debug endpoint that can analyze the current user's token and authentication state
  - Test with the user's actual token to pinpoint the exact failure point
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.1, 3.3_
