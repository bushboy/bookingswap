## Introduction

The Booking Swap Platform is a decentralized application that enables users to securely exchange bookings for events, hotel stays, and other reservations using Hedera blockchain technology. The platform provides a trustless environment where users can swap bookings without intermediaries, ensuring transparency, security, and immutable transaction records.
