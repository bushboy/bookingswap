# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature reinstates the swap initiation button on booking cards in the booking listing page. Currently, booking owners can edit their bookings but cannot easily initiate a swap directly from the booking card when no swap is currently active. This enhancement adds back the "Create Swap" button next to the edit button, allowing users to quickly enable swapping for their bookings without navigating to separate pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Swap Button Visibility

**User Story:** As a booking owner, I want to see a "Create Swap" button on my booking cards so that I can quickly initiate swapping for my bookings.

2. WHEN a booking has no active swap THEN the system SHALL show the "Create Swap" button as available
3. WHEN a booking already has an active swap THEN the system SHALL show "Manage Swap" instead of "Create Swap"
4. WHEN a booking is not in available status THEN the system SHALL disable the "Create Swap" button
5. IF a booking cannot support swapping due to business rules THEN the system SHALL hide the "Create Swap" button
6. WHEN the "Create Swap" button is disabled THEN the system SHALL provide a tooltip explaining why
7. WHEN the button is clicked THEN the system SHALL prevent event propagation to avoid triggering card click events
8. IF the user has insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL hide the "Create Swap" button

### Requirement 2: Swap Creation Integration

**User Story:** As a booking owner, I want the "Create Swap" button to open the swap creation interface so that I can configure swap preferences for my booking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Create Swap" button THEN the system SHALL trigger the swap creation workflow
2. WHEN the swap creation is initiated THEN the system SHALL pass the booking information to the swap creation interface
3. WHEN the swap creation interface opens THEN the system SHALL pre-populate booking details
4. WHEN swap creation is completed THEN the system SHALL update the booking card to reflect the new swap status
5. IF swap creation is cancelled THEN the system SHALL return to the booking listing without changes
6. WHEN swap creation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
7. WHEN a swap is successfully created THEN the system SHALL update the button to show "Manage Swap"
8. IF the swap creation process is interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle the state gracefully

### Requirement 3: Button Styling and Placement

**User Story:** As a booking owner, I want the swap button to be clearly visible and appropriately styled so that I can easily identify and use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing booking cards THEN the system SHALL place the "Create Swap" button adjacent to the edit button
2. WHEN both buttons are present THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent spacing and alignment
3. WHEN the button is active THEN the system SHALL use appropriate styling to indicate it's clickable
4. WHEN the button is disabled THEN the system SHALL use disabled styling with reduced opacity
5. IF screen space is limited THEN the system SHALL maintain button visibility through responsive design
6. WHEN hovering over the button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
7. WHEN the button text is too long for the container THEN the system SHALL handle text overflow appropriately
8. IF accessibility requirements apply THEN the system SHALL ensure proper contrast and focus indicators

### Requirement 4: Integration with Existing Swap Management

**User Story:** As a booking owner with existing swaps, I want the button to reflect my current swap status so that I understand what actions are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking has an active swap THEN the system SHALL show "Manage Swap" instead of "Create Swap"
2. WHEN a swap has pending proposals THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the button or nearby
3. WHEN a swap is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate status indicators
4. WHEN a swap is completed THEN the system SHALL update the button state accordingly
5. IF a swap is cancelled THEN the system SHALL revert to showing "Create Swap"

7. WHEN multiple swap states exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most relevant action
8. IF swap data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 5: Mobile and Responsive Behavior
