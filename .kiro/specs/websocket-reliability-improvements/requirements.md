# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current real-time communication system experiences frequent WebSocket connection failures, causing errors like "WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3001/ws' failed" and preventing users from receiving real-time updates for bookings, swaps, and proposals. This feature addresses the reliability issues by implementing proper error handling, connection management, and fallback mechanisms.

## Glossary

- **RealtimeService**: Frontend service responsible for managing WebSocket connections and real-time communication
- **WebSocketService**: Backend service using Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **Connection_Manager**: Component responsible for establishing and maintaining WebSocket connections
- **Fallback_Mechanism**: Alternative communication method when WebSocket connections fail
- **Reconnection_Strategy**: Logic for automatically re-establishing failed connections

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates to work reliably, so that I receive immediate notifications about booking changes, swap proposals, and auction events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts, THE Connection_Manager SHALL establish a WebSocket connection within 5 seconds
2. WHILE the WebSocket connection is active, THE RealtimeService SHALL maintain heartbeat communication every 30 seconds
3. IF the WebSocket connection fails, THEN THE Connection_Manager SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff up to 10 times
4. WHERE the user has an active session, THE RealtimeService SHALL automatically subscribe to relevant channels upon connection
5. WHEN a connection is re-established after failure, THE RealtimeService SHALL restore all previous subscriptions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for WebSocket failures, so that connection issues are properly logged and don't cause application crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WebSocket connection fails, THE RealtimeService SHALL log the error with connection details and timestamp
2. WHILE connection attempts are in progress, THE RealtimeService SHALL prevent duplicate connection requests
3. IF authentication fails during WebSocket handshake, THEN THE RealtimeService SHALL emit an authentication error event
4. THE RealtimeService SHALL handle malformed messages without crashing the connection
5. WHEN maximum reconnection attempts are reached, THE RealtimeService SHALL emit a permanent failure event

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work even when real-time features are unavailable, so that I can still use core functionality during connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connection is unavailable, THE Fallback_Mechanism SHALL enable polling-based updates every 30 seconds
2. WHILE using fallback mode, THE RealtimeService SHALL display connection status to users
3. IF real-time connection is restored, THEN THE Fallback_Mechanism SHALL automatically disable polling
4. THE RealtimeService SHALL provide offline-capable functionality for critical operations
5. WHEN in fallback mode, THE RealtimeService SHALL queue outgoing messages for transmission upon reconnection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and diagnostics for WebSocket connections, so that I can identify and resolve connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RealtimeService SHALL expose connection status metrics including uptime and failure counts
2. WHEN connection issues occur, THE RealtimeService SHALL provide diagnostic information about the failure cause
3. THE RealtimeService SHALL track message delivery success rates and latency
4. WHILE debugging is enabled, THE RealtimeService SHALL provide detailed connection logs
5. THE RealtimeService SHALL support health check endpoints for monitoring systems
