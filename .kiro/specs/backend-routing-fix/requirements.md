# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The booking-swap-backend service is failing to start with the error "Route.get() requires a callback function but got a [object Undefined]". This error occurs when Express route handlers are not properly defined or exported. The issue has been identified in the notification routes where the router creation function is missing a return statement, causing undefined route handlers to be registered.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend server to start successfully without routing errors, so that the application can serve API requests properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server starts THEN it SHALL complete initialization without throwing routing-related errors
2. WHEN the notification routes are registered THEN the system SHALL have properly defined callback functions for all route handlers
3. WHEN the createNotificationRoutes function is called THEN it SHALL return a valid Express Router instance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all route creation functions to follow consistent patterns, so that similar issues are prevented in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any route creation function is defined THEN it SHALL explicitly return the router instance
2. WHEN route handlers are registered THEN they SHALL have valid callback functions
3. IF a route creation function is missing a return statement THEN the system SHALL identify and fix the issue

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the server startup process to be reliable, so that deployments and restarts work consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL log successful initialization messages
2. WHEN all routes are registered THEN the system SHALL be ready to handle incoming requests
3. WHEN the health check endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL respond with appropriate status information
