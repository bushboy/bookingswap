# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix the missing return statement in notification routes





  - Add the missing `return router;` statement to the `createNotificationRoutes` function
  - Add explicit return type annotation `: Router` to the function signature
  - Verify the function follows the same pattern as other route creation functions
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.1_

- [x] 2. Add return type annotations to all route creation functions





  - Review all route creation functions in the routes directory
  - Add explicit `: Router` return type annotations where missing
  - Ensure consistency across all route creation functions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Create unit tests for route creation functions





  - Write test to verify `createNotificationRoutes` returns a Router instance
  - Write test to verify all route handlers are properly defined
  - Add test coverage for route creation function consistency
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2_

- [x] 4. Add server startup integration test





  - Create test that verifies server starts without routing errors
  - Test that all routes are properly registered during startup
  - Verify health check endpoints are accessible after startup
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Test the fix by starting the server





  - Run the backend server to verify it starts without errors
  - Check that all API endpoints are accessible
  - Verify notification routes respond correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2_
