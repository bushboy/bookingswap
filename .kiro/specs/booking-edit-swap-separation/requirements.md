# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature separates the booking edit functionality from swap creation to provide a cleaner, more focused user experience. Currently, the booking edit page includes swap functionality that can be confusing for users who simply want to edit their booking details. This change will create a clear distinction between editing booking information and creating swap proposals, with the "Enable Swapping" button redirecting users to a dedicated booking swap specification screen instead of being equivalent to edit functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Focused Booking Edit Interface

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the booking edit page to focus solely on editing booking details so that I can modify my booking information without being distracted by swap-related options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the booking edit page THEN the system SHALL display only booking-related fields and controls
2. WHEN editing a booking THEN the system SHALL NOT display swap creation or management options
3. WHEN a user saves booking changes THEN the system SHALL update only the booking information without affecting any existing swap proposals
4. WHEN booking details are modified THEN the system SHALL validate only booking-specific requirements
5. IF a booking has active swap proposals THEN the system SHALL still allow booking edits but warn about potential impacts
6. WHEN booking edits are saved THEN the system SHALL maintain any existing swap proposal associations
7. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages related only to booking fields
8. IF a user cancels editing THEN the system SHALL return to the previous view without any swap-related side effects

### Requirement 2: Dedicated Swap Specification Navigation

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the "Enable Swapping" button to take me to a dedicated swap specification screen so that I can create swap proposals in a focused environment designed specifically for that purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Enable Swapping" from the booking edit page THEN the system SHALL navigate to a dedicated booking swap specification screen
2. WHEN the swap specification screen loads THEN the system SHALL pre-populate it with the current booking information
3. WHEN creating a swap proposal THEN the system SHALL provide all swap-specific options and controls in the dedicated interface
4. WHEN a swap proposal is created THEN the system SHALL associate it with the booking and redirect to an appropriate confirmation or management view
5. IF the booking already has active swap proposals THEN the system SHALL navigate to the swap management screen instead
6. WHEN navigating to swap specification THEN the system SHALL preserve any unsaved booking edits by prompting the user to save or discard changes
7. WHEN returning from swap specification THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation back to booking management
8. IF swap creation fails THEN the system SHALL remain on the swap specification screen with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3: Clear Interface Separation

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want clear visual and functional separation between booking editing and swap creation so that I understand which actions affect my booking versus my swap proposals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the booking edit interface THEN the system SHALL use distinct visual styling that indicates booking-focused functionality
2. WHEN viewing the swap specification interface THEN the system SHALL use distinct visual styling that indicates swap-focused functionality
3. WHEN navigating between interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide clear breadcrumbs or navigation indicators
4. WHEN on the booking edit page THEN the system SHALL display only booking-related action buttons and controls
5. WHEN on the swap specification page THEN the system SHALL display only swap-related action buttons and controls
6. IF a user is confused about which interface they're on THEN the system SHALL provide clear page titles and context indicators
7. WHEN help or guidance is needed THEN the system SHALL provide context-appropriate help content for each interface
8. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whether they relate to booking or swap functionality

### Requirement 4: Preserved Functionality Integration

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want all existing booking and swap functionality to remain available so that the interface separation doesn't reduce the platform's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing bookings THEN the system SHALL maintain all current booking edit capabilities
2. WHEN creating swap proposals THEN the system SHALL maintain all current swap creation capabilities
3. WHEN managing existing swaps THEN the system SHALL provide access to all current swap management features
4. WHEN viewing booking lists THEN the system SHALL continue to show swap status indicators and quick actions
5. IF a booking has multiple swap proposals THEN the system SHALL provide access to manage all of them from the appropriate interface
6. WHEN notifications occur THEN the system SHALL continue to provide swap-related notifications with appropriate navigation
7. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design for both separated interfaces
8. IF accessibility features are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain full accessibility compliance for both interfaces

### Requirement 5: Data Consistency and State Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to ensure data consistency when booking and swap operations are separated so that no data is lost or corrupted during the interface transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN booking edits are saved THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity with any associated swap proposals
2. WHEN swap proposals are created or modified THEN the system SHALL ensure they remain properly linked to their source bookings
3. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully without data loss
4. WHEN navigation occurs between interfaces THEN the system SHALL preserve any unsaved changes with appropriate user prompts
5. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain data consistency
6. WHEN caching is involved THEN the system SHALL ensure cache invalidation maintains consistency between booking and swap data
7. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN the system SHALL update both booking and swap interfaces appropriately
8. IF rollback operations are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain the ability to revert changes without affecting related data

### Requirement 6: User Experience and Navigation Flow

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want intuitive navigation between booking editing and swap creation so that I can efficiently manage both aspects of my bookings without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting from a booking list THEN the system SHALL provide clear entry points for both editing and swap creation
2. WHEN completing booking edits THEN the system SHALL offer logical next steps including swap creation if appropriate
3. WHEN completing swap creation THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation back to booking management or other relevant areas
4. WHEN using browser navigation THEN the system SHALL handle back/forward buttons appropriately for both interfaces
5. IF deep linking is used THEN the system SHALL support direct links to both booking edit and swap specification screens
6. WHEN bookmarks are created THEN the system SHALL ensure they work correctly for both interface types
7. WHEN sharing links THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate URLs that maintain context for both booking and swap operations
8. IF users need to switch contexts frequently THEN the system SHALL provide efficient navigation patterns to support this workflow
