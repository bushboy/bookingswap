# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for removing the polling functionality from the swap proposal page that is causing hanging issues. The current implementation uses fallback polling when WebSocket connections are unhealthy, but this polling mechanism is causing performance problems and needs to be removed.

## Glossary

- **Polling**: A technique where the client repeatedly requests data from the server at regular intervals
- **WebSocket**: A communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection
- **Fallback Polling**: A backup mechanism that activates when WebSocket connections fail or become unhealthy
- **SwapProposal System**: The component responsible for managing swap proposal functionality and real-time updates
- **useFallbackPolling Hook**: The React hook that implements the fallback polling mechanism
- **useWebSocket Hook**: The React hook that manages WebSocket connections and includes fallback polling integration

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing swap proposals, I want the page to load without hanging, so that I can interact with the interface smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the swap proposal page loads, THE SwapProposal System SHALL complete loading without hanging or blocking the UI
2. WHEN WebSocket connections fail, THE SwapProposal System SHALL handle the failure gracefully without activating polling mechanisms
3. THE SwapProposal System SHALL maintain all existing functionality except for the polling fallback mechanism
4. THE SwapProposal System SHALL continue to receive real-time updates through WebSocket connections when available
5. WHEN WebSocket connections are unavailable, THE SwapProposal System SHALL display appropriate status messages without attempting to poll

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the polling code removed cleanly, so that the system is simpler and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE useFallbackPolling Hook SHALL be completely removed from the codebase
2. THE useWebSocket Hook SHALL be updated to remove all references to fallback polling
3. THE SwapProposal System SHALL not contain any setInterval or setTimeout calls for polling purposes
4. THE system SHALL maintain all existing WebSocket functionality without polling dependencies
5. THE codebase SHALL have no unused imports or references to the removed polling functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reduced server load from unnecessary polling requests, so that the system performs better overall.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwapProposal System SHALL not generate any automatic polling requests to the server
2. WHEN WebSocket connections are healthy, THE system SHALL continue to operate normally with real-time updates
3. THE system SHALL reduce overall network traffic by eliminating polling requests
4. THE SwapProposal System SHALL maintain data freshness through WebSocket events only
5. THE system SHALL handle connection failures by displaying appropriate user feedback without polling
