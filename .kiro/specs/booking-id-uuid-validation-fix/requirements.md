# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The booking-swap-backend service is experiencing UUID validation errors when route path segments like "my-bookings" are incorrectly interpreted as booking ID parameters. The database expects valid UUID format for booking IDs, but string values from route paths are being passed to UUID-expecting database queries, causing PostgreSQL errors with code "22P02" (invalid input syntax for type uuid). This issue indicates improper route parameter handling and lack of UUID validation before database operations.

## Glossary

- **Booking_Service**: The backend service responsible for managing booking operations and database interactions
- **Route_Handler**: Express.js middleware functions that process HTTP requests for specific URL patterns
- **UUID_Validator**: A validation mechanism that ensures booking ID parameters conform to UUID format before database operations
- **Database_Query**: SQL operations that interact with PostgreSQL database tables expecting UUID-typed parameters

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Route Parameter Validation

**User Story:** As a backend service, I want to validate booking ID parameters before database operations, so that invalid UUID formats are rejected with appropriate error responses instead of causing database errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking ID parameter is received in a route THEN the Booking_Service SHALL validate that it conforms to UUID format
2. WHEN a booking ID parameter is not a valid UUID THEN the Booking_Service SHALL return a 400 Bad Request response with a descriptive error message
3. WHEN a booking ID parameter is a valid UUID THEN the Booking_Service SHALL proceed with the database operation
4. WHEN UUID validation fails THEN the Booking_Service SHALL log the invalid parameter value for debugging purposes
5. WHEN route parameters are processed THEN the UUID_Validator SHALL check format before any Database_Query execution

### Requirement 2: Route Path Disambiguation

**User Story:** As a backend service, I want to properly distinguish between route paths and booking ID parameters, so that path segments like "my-bookings" are not mistakenly treated as booking IDs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN routes are defined THEN the Route_Handler SHALL use specific route patterns that clearly separate path segments from booking ID parameters
2. WHEN a request matches "/bookings/my-bookings" THEN the Booking_Service SHALL route to the user's bookings endpoint, not treat "my-bookings" as a booking ID
3. WHEN a request matches "/bookings/:bookingId" THEN the Booking_Service SHALL validate the bookingId parameter as a UUID
4. WHEN route patterns overlap THEN the Booking_Service SHALL prioritize specific routes over parameterized routes
5. WHEN routing conflicts exist THEN the Route_Handler SHALL resolve them in favor of explicit path matches

### Requirement 3: Error Response Standardization

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent error responses for invalid booking ID parameters, so that I can handle validation errors appropriately in the user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UUID validation fails THEN the Booking_Service SHALL return a standardized error response with status 400
2. WHEN error responses are sent THEN they SHALL include a clear error message indicating the parameter validation failure
3. WHEN booking ID format is invalid THEN the error response SHALL specify that a valid UUID format is required
4. WHEN multiple validation errors occur THEN the Booking_Service SHALL return all validation errors in a structured format
5. WHEN error logging occurs THEN the system SHALL include request context and parameter values for debugging

### Requirement 4: Database Query Protection

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want all booking-related queries to receive properly validated UUID parameters, so that database errors and potential security issues are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Database_Query operations are executed THEN they SHALL only receive validated UUID parameters
2. WHEN booking ID parameters are passed to queries THEN the UUID_Validator SHALL have already confirmed their format
3. WHEN parameterized queries are constructed THEN they SHALL assume all booking IDs are valid UUIDs
4. WHEN database errors occur due to invalid UUIDs THEN they SHALL be prevented by pre-query validation
5. WHEN query execution begins THEN all UUID parameters SHALL have been validated at the route handler level

### Requirement 5: Route Handler Middleware Integration

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want UUID validation to be integrated as middleware, so that validation logic is reusable and consistently applied across all booking-related routes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN booking routes are defined THEN they SHALL use UUID validation middleware for booking ID parameters
2. WHEN validation middleware is applied THEN it SHALL execute before the main route handler logic
3. WHEN middleware validation passes THEN the request SHALL proceed to the route handler with validated parameters
4. WHEN middleware validation fails THEN the request SHALL be terminated with an appropriate error response
5. WHEN multiple routes require UUID validation THEN they SHALL use the same validation middleware for consistency

### Requirement 6: Logging and Monitoring Enhancement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed logging of UUID validation failures, so that I can monitor for potential issues and debug routing problems effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UUID validation fails THEN the Booking_Service SHALL log the invalid parameter value and request details
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the logs SHALL include the request path, method, and client information
3. WHEN frequent validation failures happen THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for monitoring
4. WHEN debugging routing issues THEN the logs SHALL contain sufficient information to identify the problem source
5. WHEN error patterns emerge THEN the logging SHALL facilitate identification of systematic issues
