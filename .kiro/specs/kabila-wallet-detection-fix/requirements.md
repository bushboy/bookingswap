# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the complete Kabila wallet integration flow where users should be able to detect the installed Kabila wallet chrome extension, select it from the wallet options, connect to it, and have the app properly recognize the connection. Currently, the application fails to properly handle this flow, preventing users from successfully connecting their Kabila wallet for trading operations.

## Glossary

- **Kabila Wallet Extension**: The chrome browser extension that provides Hedera wallet functionality
- **Wallet Connection Detection System**: The component responsible for determining if the Kabila wallet is properly connected and accessible
- **Validation Service**: The service that orchestrates wallet connection and balance validation
- **Connection State Synchronization**: The process of ensuring UI state matches actual Kabila wallet connection status

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the app to detect when I have the Kabila wallet extension installed, so that I can see it as an available wallet option.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Kabila wallet chrome extension is installed, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL detect its availability through the window.kabila interface
2. WHEN the app loads, THE Validation Service SHALL check for Kabila wallet availability and include it in the available wallet providers list
3. WHEN Kabila wallet is available, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL display "Kabila Wallet" as a selectable option in the wallet selection interface
4. WHEN Kabila wallet is not installed, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL hide the Kabila option from the wallet selection interface
5. THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL provide clear feedback about Kabila wallet availability status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to be able to select and connect to my Kabila wallet when I click on it from the wallet options, so that I can authenticate and access my wallet account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the Kabila wallet option, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL initiate the connection process using the KabilaAdapter
2. WHEN the connection process starts, THE Validation Service SHALL call window.kabila.connect() to request wallet access
3. WHEN the user approves the connection in the Kabila extension, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL receive the account information
4. WHEN the connection is successful, THE Validation Service SHALL store the connection details and update the UI to show connected status
5. WHEN the connection fails, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL display appropriate error messages with guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the app to properly recognize when my Kabila wallet is connected, so that I can proceed with trading operations without false "wallet not connected" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Kabila wallet connection is established, THE Validation Service SHALL accurately detect the connection status using multiple validation methods
2. WHEN performing wallet validation for trading operations, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL correctly identify connected Kabila wallets
3. WHEN a Kabila wallet is connected, THE Validation Service SHALL retrieve and validate account information including account ID and balance
4. WHEN the connection is valid, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL allow users to proceed with swap creation and other trading operations
5. THE Validation Service SHALL maintain consistent connection state across all application components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want clear error messages and guidance when Kabila wallet connection issues occur, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Kabila wallet extension is not installed, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL display a message with installation instructions
2. WHEN the Kabila wallet is locked, THE Validation Service SHALL prompt the user to unlock their wallet
3. WHEN a user rejects the connection request in Kabila, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL display a message explaining the connection was declined
4. WHEN there are network connectivity issues with Kabila, THE Validation Service SHALL display a retry option with appropriate messaging
5. THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL provide specific troubleshooting guidance based on the type of Kabila connection error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want my Kabila wallet connection to persist and be restored when I return to the application, so that I don't have to reconnect every time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully connects their Kabila wallet, THE Validation Service SHALL store the connection preference locally
2. WHEN a user returns to the application, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL attempt to restore the previous Kabila wallet connection
3. WHEN the stored Kabila connection is no longer valid, THE Validation Service SHALL gracefully fall back to the disconnected state
4. WHEN a user clears their browser data, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL require a fresh Kabila wallet connection
5. WHEN Kabila connection restoration fails, THE Validation Service SHALL log the error and show the connect wallet interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust Kabila wallet integration that handles chrome extension edge cases and timing issues, so that users have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL handle Kabila extension loading delays gracefully by implementing appropriate timeouts
2. WHEN Kabila wallet APIs are slow or unresponsive, THE Validation Service SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. THE Validation Service SHALL validate Kabila wallet connection using both window.kabila.isConnected() and account verification
4. WHEN Kabila connection validation encounters errors, THE Wallet Connection Detection System SHALL provide fallback validation methods
5. THE Validation Service SHALL properly integrate with the existing KabilaAdapter implementation without breaking existing functionality
