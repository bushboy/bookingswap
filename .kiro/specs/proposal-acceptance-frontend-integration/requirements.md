# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature connects the existing frontend proposal acceptance UI components to the backend API endpoints. The backend ProposalAcceptanceService and API endpoints are fully implemented and functional, but the frontend components are currently showing placeholder alerts instead of making actual API calls. This integration will enable users to accept and reject swap proposals through the UI.

## Glossary

- **Frontend_Integration_System**: The system component that connects UI components to backend APIs
- **ProposalAcceptanceAPI**: The existing frontend service for making proposal API calls
- **Redux_Store**: The frontend state management system for proposal data
- **SwapsPage**: The main page displaying user's swap proposals
- **ProposalActionButtons**: The UI component with accept/reject buttons
- **Backend_API**: The existing REST API endpoints for proposal acceptance/rejection

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Connect SwapsPage to Real API Calls

**User Story:** As a user viewing my swap proposals, I want to accept or reject proposals through the UI so that the actions are processed by the backend system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Accept" on a proposal THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL call the real proposalAcceptanceAPI.acceptProposal method
2. WHEN a user clicks "Reject" on a proposal THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL call the real proposalAcceptanceAPI.rejectProposal method
3. WHEN API calls are successful THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL update the Redux_Store with the new proposal status
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
5. WHEN proposals are processed THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL refresh the proposal list to show updated statuses

### Requirement 2: Replace Mock Redux Thunks with Real API Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Redux thunks to use the real API service instead of mock data so that the state management reflects actual backend operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN acceptProposal thunk is dispatched THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL use the real proposalAcceptanceAPI service
2. WHEN rejectProposal thunk is dispatched THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL use the real proposalAcceptanceAPI service  
3. WHEN API calls succeed THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL update the Redux state with actual response data
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL handle errors and update state accordingly
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL maintain optimistic updates for better UX

### Requirement 3: Enable Real-time Proposal Status Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see immediate feedback when I accept or reject proposals so that I know my actions were processed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a proposal action is initiated THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL show loading states on action buttons
2. WHEN a proposal is accepted THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL immediately update the UI to show "accepted" status
3. WHEN a proposal is rejected THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL immediately update the UI to show "rejected" status
4. WHEN actions complete THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL show success notifications to the user
5. WHEN actions fail THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL revert optimistic updates and show error messages
### 
Requirement 4: Integrate Proposal Data Loading

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my received proposals with accurate data so that I can make informed decisions about accepting or rejecting them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SwapsPage loads THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL fetch real proposal data from the Backend_API
2. WHEN proposals are displayed THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL show accurate proposal details including proposer information
3. WHEN proposal data is unavailable THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL display appropriate empty states
4. WHEN proposal data fails to load THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL show error messages with retry options
5. WHEN proposals are updated THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL refresh the display without requiring page reload

### Requirement 5: Handle Payment and Blockchain Integration

**User Story:** As a user accepting financial proposals, I want payment processing and blockchain recording to work seamlessly so that funds are transferred and transactions are recorded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accepting a financial proposal THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL display payment processing status
2. WHEN payment processing occurs THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL show progress indicators to the user
3. WHEN blockchain recording happens THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL display transaction confirmation details
4. WHEN payment or blockchain operations fail THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL show specific error messages
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL display success confirmation with transaction details

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when proposal actions fail so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL display "Network error" messages with retry options
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL redirect users to login
3. WHEN proposals are not found THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL display "Proposal not found" messages
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL display specific validation error messages
5. WHEN server errors occur THEN the Frontend_Integration_System SHALL display generic error messages with support contact information
