# 🔍 API Debug Test - Booking Load Issue

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
The error `dbBookings.map is not a function` was caused by the backend API response format not matching what the frontend expected.

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**
Updated the frontend to handle the correct backend API response format:

### **Backend API Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "bookings": [
      {
        "id": "uuid",
        "title": "Booking Title",
        "city": "Paris",
        "country": "France",
        // ... other booking fields
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "limit": 100,
      "offset": 0,
      "total": 1
    },
    "filters": {}
  }
}
```

### **Frontend Fix:**
- Now correctly extracts bookings from `responseData.data.bookings`
- Added fallback handling for different response formats
- Enhanced error logging for debugging

## 🧪 **Test the Fix**

### **1. Check Browser Console:**
After the fix, you should see:
```
Loading bookings from database...
API response: { success: true, data: { bookings: [...] } }
Processing bookings: [...]
Successfully loaded X bookings from database
```

### **2. Test API Directly:**
```bash
# Test the API endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:3001/api/bookings

# Should return JSON with the structure above
```

### **3. Verify Frontend:**
1. Refresh the `/bookings` page
2. Check browser console for success messages
3. Bookings should load from database (or show mock data if database is empty)

## 🔄 **Expected Behavior Now:**

### **If Database Has Bookings:**
- Bookings load from PostgreSQL database
- Mock data is replaced with real data
- Console shows "Successfully loaded X bookings from database"

### **If Database Is Empty:**
- Mock data remains visible
- Console shows "No bookings found in database, keeping mock data"
- You can create new bookings which will be saved to database

### **If API Fails:**
- Mock data remains visible
- Console shows error message
- Application continues to work with mock data

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the fix** - Refresh the bookings page
2. **Check console** - Should see success messages
3. **Create a booking** - Test that new bookings save to database
4. **Verify persistence** - Refresh page to see if bookings persist

The booking loading should now work correctly! 🎉
