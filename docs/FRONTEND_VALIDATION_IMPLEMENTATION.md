   - ✅ Shows errors immediately when field loses focus
   - ✅ Matches backend validation rules exactly
   - ✅ Prevents form submission with errors

2. **Comprehensive Validation Rules**
   - ✅ **Required Fields**: All backend required fields validated
   - ✅ **Length Limits**: Min/max character limits enforced
   - ✅ **Data Types**: Number validation for prices
   - ✅ **Date Logic**: Check-in before check-out, no past dates
   - ✅ **Business Rules**: Reasonable price limits

3. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - ✅ **Visual Error Summary**: Shows all errors at top of form
   - ✅ **Helper Text**: Guides users on requirements
   - ✅ **Required Field Indicators**: Asterisks (*) show required fields
   - ✅ **Disabled Submit**: Button disabled when errors exist
   - ✅ **Error Styling**: Red borders and text for invalid fields

## 🔧 **Validation Rules Implemented**

### **Required Fields (Backend Match):**
- ✅ **Booking Type** - Must select hotel/event/flight/rental
- ✅ **Title** - 3-255 characters
- ✅ **Description** - 10-1000 characters  
- ✅ **City** - 2-100 characters

### **Real-Time Validation Triggers:**
- ✅ **On Type** - For fields user has interacted with
- ✅ **On Blur** - When user leaves a field
- ✅ **On Change** - For dropdowns and date pickers
- ✅ **Cross-Field** - Check-out validates against check-in

## 🎨 **UI/UX Improvements**

### **Visual Indicators:**
```
💡 Helper text at top explains requirements
⚠️ Error summary shows all issues at once
🔴 Red borders highlight invalid fields
❌ Error messages appear below each field
🚫 Submit button disabled when errors exist
```

### **User Flow:**
1. **User opens form** → Sees helper text and required field indicators
2. **User starts typing** → Real-time validation begins
3. **User makes error** → Immediate feedback with specific message
4. **User fixes error** → Error disappears instantly
5. **All fields valid** → Submit button becomes enabled
6. **Form submission** → No backend validation errors!

## 🧪 **Test the Validation**

### **Try These Scenarios:**

1. **Empty Fields**:
   - Leave title empty → "Title is required"
   - Leave description empty → "Description is required"

2. **Length Validation**:
   - Type "Hi" in title → "Title must be at least 3 characters"
   - Type very long description → "Description must be less than 1000 characters"

3. **Date Validation**:
   - Select yesterday for check-in → "Check-in date cannot be in the past"
   - Select check-out before check-in → "Check-out date must be after check-in date"

4. **Price Validation**:
   - Enter 0 for price → "Original price must be greater than 0"
   - Enter negative number → "Swap value must be greater than 0"

5. **Provider Validation**:
   - Leave provider empty → "Provider is required"
   - Enter "AB" for confirmation → "Confirmation number must be at least 3 characters"

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ **Errors appear instantly** as you type or leave fields
- ✅ **Error summary updates** showing all current issues
- ✅ **Submit button disabled** until all errors fixed
- ✅ **No backend errors** when form is submitted
- ✅ **Smooth user experience** with clear guidance
