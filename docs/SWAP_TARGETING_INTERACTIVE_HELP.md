# Swap Targeting Display - Interactive Help Guide

## Interactive Help System Design

This document outlines the design for an interactive help system that provides contextual, step-by-step guidance for the Swap Targeting Display feature.

## Help System Architecture

### Context-Aware Help

The interactive help system detects user context and provides relevant assistance:

```javascript
// Context detection examples
const helpContexts = {
  'swaps-page-first-visit': {
    trigger: 'user visits /swaps for first time',
    help: 'targeting-overview-tour'
  },
  'new-targeting-proposal': {
    trigger: 'user receives first targeting proposal',
    help: 'proposal-management-guide'
  },
  'targeting-action-failed': {
    trigger: 'targeting action returns error',
    help: 'troubleshooting-wizard'
  },
  'mobile-first-use': {
    trigger: 'mobile user accesses targeting features',
    help: 'mobile-optimization-tips'
  }
};
```
