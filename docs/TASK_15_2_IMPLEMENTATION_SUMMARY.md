# Task 15.2 Implementation Summary: Email Notification Templates

## Overview
Successfully implemented email notification templates and notification preference management for proposal acceptance, rejection, and payment completion as required by task 15.2.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Email Templates (Already Existed)
The following email templates were already present in `NotificationTemplateService.ts`:
- ✅ **Proposal Accepted Template** (`proposal_accepted`)
  - Comprehensive email with proposal details, swap information, and payment details
  - Includes next steps and dashboard links
  - Available for email, SMS, and in-app channels

- ✅ **Proposal Rejected Template** (`proposal_rejected`) 
  - Email template with rejection details and optional reason
  - Includes swap details and encouragement to browse other opportunities
  - Available for email, SMS, and in-app channels

- ✅ **Payment Completion Template** (`proposal_payment_completed`)
  - Detailed payment confirmation with transaction information
  - Role-specific messaging for payer vs recipient
  - Includes transaction ID, amount, and next steps

- ✅ **Payment Failed Template** (`proposal_payment_failed`)
  - Error notification with failure details and retry instructions
  - Urgent priority handling for payment failures
  - Includes error messages and support guidance

### 2. Notification Preference Management (New Implementation)
Enhanced `NotificationPreferencesService.ts` with:

#### New Interface: `ProposalResponseNotificationPreferences`
```typescript
export interface ProposalResponseNotificationPreferences {
  proposalAccepted: {
    enabled: boolean;
    channels: NotificationChannel[];
    includeSwapDetails: boolean;
    includePaymentInfo: boolean;
    notifyProposer: boolean;
    notifyBookingHolder: boolean;
  };
  proposalRejected: {
    enabled: boolean;
    channels: NotificationChannel[];
    includeRejectionReason: boolean;
    includeAlternativeSuggestions: boolean;
    notifyProposer: boolean;
    notifyBookingHolder: boolean;
  };
  paymentCompleted: {
    enabled: boolean;
    channels: NotificationChannel[];
    includeTransactionDetails: boolean;
    includeReceiptInfo: boolean;
    notifyPayer: boolean;
    notifyRecipient: boolean;
  };
  paymentFailed: {
    enabled: boolean;
    channels: NotificationChannel[];
    includeErrorDetails: boolean;
    includeRetryInstructions: boolean;
    urgentNotification: boolean;
  };
}
```

#### New Methods Added:
- `getProposalResponseNotificationPreferences(userId: string)`
- `updateProposalResponseNotificationPreferences(userId: string, preferences: Partial<ProposalResponseNotificationPreferences>)`
- `getProposalResponseNotificationChannels(userId: string, notificationType: NotificationType, userRole: string)`
- `shouldIncludeProposalResponseContent(userId: string, notificationType: NotificationType, contentType: string)`

### 3. Integration Service (New Implementation)
Created `ProposalResponseNotificationService.ts` that:
- Orchestrates sending proposal response notifications
- Respects user notification preferences
- Handles role-based notifications (proposer vs booking holder, payer vs recipient)
- Provides content customization based on user preferences
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

#### Key Features:
- **Role-based notifications**: Different content for proposers vs booking holders
- **Preference-aware**: Only sends notifications user wants to receive
- **Channel selection**: Uses user's preferred notification channels
- **Content customization**: Includes/excludes content based on user preferences
- **Error resilience**: Graceful fallbacks when preferences can't be loaded

## Requirements Satisfied

### ✅ 7.1 - Notification System Integration
- Integrated with existing NotificationService and template system
- Supports all notification channels (email, SMS, in-app, push)
- Proper error handling and logging

### ✅ 7.2 - User Communication
- Sends notifications to both parties involved in proposal responses
- Clear, actionable messaging with appropriate tone
- Includes relevant context and next steps

### ✅ 7.3 - Payment Notifications
- Comprehensive payment completion and failure notifications
- Transaction details and receipt information
- Role-specific messaging for payers and recipients

### ✅ 7.5 - Notification Preferences
- Full preference management system for proposal responses
- Granular control over notification types and channels
- Content inclusion preferences (swap details, payment info, etc.)
- Role-based notification controls

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `apps/backend/src/services/notification/NotificationPreferencesService.ts`
  - Added ProposalResponseNotificationPreferences interface
  - Added methods for managing proposal response preferences
  - Enhanced shouldSendNotification to handle proposal response types

### Created:
- `apps/backend/src/services/notification/ProposalResponseNotificationService.ts`
  - Complete service for handling proposal response notifications
  - Integration with preferences and template services
  - Role-based notification logic

### Existing (Templates Already Present):
- `apps/backend/src/services/notification/NotificationTemplateService.ts`
  - Contains all required email templates for proposal responses

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Initialize the service
const proposalResponseService = new ProposalResponseNotificationService(
  notificationService,
  userRepository
);

// Send acceptance notifications
await proposalResponseService.sendProposalAcceptanceNotifications({
  proposalId: 'prop-123',
  proposerId: 'user-456',
  targetUserId: 'user-789',
  proposalType: 'booking',
  response: 'accepted',
  sourceSwapDetails: { /* swap details */ },
  targetSwapDetails: { /* swap details */ }
});

// Send payment completion notifications
await proposalResponseService.sendPaymentCompletionNotifications({
  proposalId: 'prop-123',
  transactionId: 'txn-456',
  amount: 150,
  currency: 'USD',
  status: 'completed',
  payerUserId: 'user-456',
  recipientUserId: 'user-789'
});
```

## Implementation Notes

- All templates use Handlebars-style templating with proper variable substitution
- Notification preferences are stored in the existing user profile structure
- The service is designed to be backwards compatible with existing notification systems
- Comprehensive error handling ensures notifications don't fail silently
- Logging provides full audit trail for debugging and monitoring

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for integration with the proposal acceptance workflow. The service can be used by:
1. ProposalAcceptanceService (when proposals are accepted/rejected)
2. PaymentProcessingService (when payments complete/fail)
3. Any other service that needs to send proposal response notifications
