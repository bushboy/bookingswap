## ðŸ§ª Testing the Fixes

To verify all buttons work:

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   # Backend (Terminal 1)
   cd apps/backend
   npm run dev

   # Frontend (Terminal 2)
   cd apps/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test each page**:
   - Navigate to each page using the sidebar
   - Click every button and verify it performs the expected action
   - Test form inputs and state changes
   - Verify external links open in new tabs

3. **Expected behaviors**:
   - All navigation buttons should change the URL and load the correct page
   - Form buttons should show feedback (alerts, state changes)
   - External links should open blockchain explorer
   - Confirmation dialogs should appear for destructive actions
