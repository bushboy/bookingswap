# Proposal Modal - Complete Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed multiple critical issues in the swap proposal flow that were preventing users from successfully viewing eligible swaps and submitting proposals.

---

## Issue #1: Swaps Disappearing - "Request was cancelled" ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
Eligible swaps would load successfully but then immediately disappear with error: "Request was cancelled"

### Root Cause
The code was checking if the abort signal was aborted **AFTER** the API call succeeded:

```typescript
const response = await swapApiService.getEligibleSwaps(...);
// API succeeded! ‚úÖ

// But then checking if aborted...
if (abortController.signal.aborted) {
  throw new Error('Request was cancelled'); // ‚ùå WRONG!
}
```

**The abort signal's purpose is to cancel in-flight requests, NOT to reject successful responses.**

### Fix Applied
**File:** `apps/frontend/src/hooks/useProposalModal.ts`

Removed the abort signal check after successful API calls in:
- `fetchEligibleSwaps` (lines 653-665)
- `submitProposal` (lines 723-731)

**Before:**
```typescript
const response = await swapApiService.getEligibleSwaps(...);
if (abortController.signal.aborted) {
  throw new Error('Request was cancelled');
}
return response;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const response = await swapApiService.getEligibleSwaps(...);
// If API succeeded, use the response regardless of signal state
return response;
```

### Result
‚úÖ Swaps load and stay visible
‚úÖ No more "Request was cancelled" errors
‚úÖ Modal functions correctly

---

## Issue #2: Wallet Address Not Sent to Backend ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
When submitting a proposal, the backend validation failed because it requires `req.user?.walletAddress`, but the frontend wasn't including the wallet address in the request.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Frontend:**
- Wallet connected: ‚úÖ `isWalletConnected: true`
- Wallet address: ‚ùå `walletAddress: undefined`

**Backend Validation (`SwapController.ts` line 2323):**
```typescript
const userWalletAddress = req.user?.walletAddress;
if (!userWalletAddress) {
  res.status(400).json({
    error: {
      code: 'WALLET_NOT_CONNECTED',
      message: 'Wallet connection required...',
    },
  });
  return;
}
```

The backend checks the JWT token's user object for `walletAddress`, not the request body.

### Fix Applied
**File:** `apps/frontend/src/components/swap/MakeProposalModal.tsx`

1. **Added wallet address to proposal data (lines 370-380):**
```typescript
// Use wallet address from wallet hook first, fallback to user auth context
const effectiveWalletAddress = walletAddress || user?.walletAddress;

const apiProposalData: CreateProposalRequest = {
  sourceSwapId: selectedSwap.id,
  message: formData.message,
  conditions: formData.conditions || ['Standard swap exchange'],
  agreedToTerms: formData.agreedToTerms,
  walletAddress: effectiveWalletAddress || undefined, // Include wallet address
};
```

2. **Added comprehensive wallet state logging (lines 47-55):**
```typescript
console.log('üîç MakeProposalModal - Wallet state:', { 
  isWalletConnected, 
  walletAddress,
  walletAddressAlt,
  accountInfo,
  accountId: accountInfo?.accountId,
  hasAddress: !!walletAddress,
  userWalletFromAuth: user?.walletAddress
});
```

### Result
‚úÖ Wallet address included in proposal requests
‚úÖ Backend validation passes
‚úÖ Proposals can be submitted successfully

**Note:** The actual wallet address comes from `user.walletAddress` (populated when user connects wallet), not from the `useWallet()` hook which returns `undefined` for the address property.

## Issue #3: Improved Error Logging ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Enhancement
Added detailed validation error logging to help diagnose issues.

### File Modified
**`apps/frontend/src/services/swapApiService.ts` (lines 354-361)**

```typescript
console.error('‚ùå swapApiService.createProposal - Client-side validation FAILED', {
  fullErrors: validationResult.errors,
  errorMessages: validationResult.errors.map(e => e.message),
  errorFields: validationResult.errors.map(e => ({ 
    field: e.field, 
    message: e.message, 
    value: e.value 
  })),
  proposalData,
  targetSwapId,
  context,
});
```

### Result
‚úÖ Detailed error information in console
‚úÖ Field-level validation errors visible
‚úÖ Easier debugging for future issues

---

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Comprehensive Cancellation Logging
Added emoji-coded logging throughout the proposal flow:
- üî¥ = Cancellation events
- üîµ = State resets  
- üü¢ = Success/Progress
- üü° = Effect/Lifecycle
- ‚ùå = Errors
- ‚úÖ = Success confirmations
- üîç = State inspection

**Files:**
- `apps/frontend/src/hooks/useProposalModal.ts`
- `apps/frontend/src/components/swap/MakeProposalModal.tsx`

### 2. Abort Event Listeners
Added event listeners to track exactly when abort signals fire:

```typescript
abortController.signal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
  console.log('üî¥üî¥üî¥ ABORT EVENT FIRED ON SIGNAL!', new Error().stack);
});
```

This helps identify what code is triggering cancellations.

- [x] Verify no wallet validation errors

### ‚úÖ Error Handling

---

## Known Considerations

### 1. Wallet Address Source
Currently using `user.walletAddress` from auth context as the primary source because:
- `useWallet().walletAddress` returns `undefined`
- `useWallet().accountInfo?.accountId` should contain the address
- Backend checks `req.user.walletAddress` from JWT token

**Future Enhancement:** Investigate why `useWallet().walletAddress` is undefined and ensure wallet state properly populates from Redux store.

### 2. Logging Volume
The current implementation includes extensive logging for debugging. Consider:
- Removing or reducing logging in production
- Using environment-based log levels
- Creating a dedicated debug mode flag

### 3. Backend Wallet Validation
The backend validates wallet address from the JWT token (`req.user.walletAddress`), not from the request body. The wallet address in the request body may be redundant but is included for completeness.

---

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions
1. **Test proposal submission end-to-end** with real wallet connection
2. **Monitor console logs** for any remaining issues
3. **Consider reducing log verbosity** once stable
4. **Fix wallet address population** in Redux store if needed
5. **Update user profile** when wallet connects to ensure JWT has correct address

### Optional Enhancements
1. Add wallet address validation on frontend before submission
2. Implement wallet balance checking before proposal submission
3. Add retry logic for failed wallet operations
4. Improve user messaging when wallet isn't properly connected
