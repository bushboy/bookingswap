## Understanding Targeting Indicators

### Swap Card Indicators

When you view your swaps, each swap card now displays targeting information through visual indicators:

#### Incoming Targeting Indicator
- **Location**: Top-right corner of swap card
- **Appearance**: Badge with number and targeting icon
- **Examples**:
  - `2 targeting proposals` - Multiple users want to swap with you
  - `1 targeting proposal` - One user is interested in your swap
  - `No targeting activity` - No current targeting proposals

#### Outgoing Targeting Indicator  
- **Location**: Below swap title
- **Appearance**: Status text with target swap name
- **Examples**:
  - `Targeting: Beach House Villa` - Your swap is targeting another swap
  - `No active target` - Your swap isn't targeting anyone
  - `Matched with: Mountain Cabin` - Your targeting was accepted

#### Status Badges
- **Pending** (Yellow): Waiting for response
- **Active** (Blue): Currently targeting or being targeted
- **Accepted** (Green): Targeting proposal was accepted
- **Rejected** (Red): Targeting proposal was declined
- **Matched** (Purple): Successful swap match created

### Auction Mode vs One-for-One Mode

#### Auction Mode Indicators
- **Multiple Proposals Allowed**: Shows total number of targeting proposals
- **Countdown Timer**: Displays time remaining in auction
- **Proposal Counter**: Shows current bid count
- **Example**: `5 proposals • 2h 15m remaining`

#### One-for-One Mode Indicators
- **Single Proposal**: Shows if proposal is pending or available
- **Restriction Messages**: Explains why targeting might be unavailable
- **Example**: `Proposal pending - Cannot target`

## Viewing Incoming Targeting Proposals

### Expanding Targeting Details

1. **Find your swap card** on the `/swaps` page
2. **Look for the targeting indicator** showing incoming proposals
3. **Click "Expand Details"** or the targeting indicator itself
4. **Review proposal information** in the expanded section

### Proposal Information Displayed

Each targeting proposal shows:

- **Proposer's swap details**:
  - Property title and location
  - Check-in and check-out dates
  - Number of guests
  - Property value/price
  
- **Proposer information**:
  - User name and profile picture
  - User rating and reviews
  - Verification status

- **Proposal metadata**:
  - When the proposal was made
  - Current status
  - Compatibility indicators

### Compatibility Indicators

The system automatically checks compatibility between swaps:

- ✅ **Date Match**: Dates are compatible
- ✅ **Guest Capacity**: Guest numbers work for both properties
- ✅ **Location Preference**: Matches your location preferences
- ⚠️ **Partial Match**: Some criteria don't align perfectly
- ❌ **Incompatible**: Significant compatibility issues

## Managing Your Targeting Activity

### Viewing Your Targeting Status

Your swap cards show your current targeting activity:

1. **Active Targeting**: Which swap you're currently targeting
2. **Targeting History**: Previous targeting attempts
3. **Success Rate**: How often your proposals are accepted

### Understanding Targeting Restrictions

You may see restrictions that prevent targeting:

#### Common Restrictions
- **"Proposal Pending"**: The swap already has a pending proposal (one-for-one mode)
- **"Auction Ended"**: The auction period has expired
- **"Already Targeted"**: You're already targeting this swap
- **"Own Swap"**: You cannot target your own swaps
- **"Circular Targeting"**: Would create a circular targeting chain

#### Restriction Solutions
- **Wait for Response**: Current proposal needs to be accepted/rejected
- **Try Different Swap**: Look for other compatible options
- **Check Auction Times**: Target swaps with active auctions
- **Review Your Activity**: Ensure you're not already targeting the swap
