**Symptoms:**
- "Target My Swap" button not visible anywhere
- Message: "Create a swap to start targeting"

**Causes:**
- You haven't created a swap yet
- Your swap was cancelled or deleted
- Your swap is in draft status

**Solutions:**

1. **Create a New Swap:**
   ```
   Dashboard ‚Üí Create New Swap ‚Üí Fill Details ‚Üí Publish
   ```

2. **Check Swap Status:**
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Look for "My Swaps" section
   - Verify swap status is "Active"

3. **Restore Cancelled Swap:**
   - Check "Cancelled Swaps" in your dashboard
   - Click "Restore" if available
   - Or create a new swap with same details

**Prevention:**
- Keep at least one active swap
- Set up notifications for swap status changes
- Regularly check your dashboard

### Targeting Own Swap

**Symptoms:**
- "Target My Swap" button not visible on your swap
- Message: "This is your swap"

**Explanation:**
You cannot target your own swaps. This prevents self-proposals and maintains system integrity.

**Solutions:**

1. **Target Other Users' Swaps:**
   - Browse swaps from other users
   - Use filters to find suitable matches
   - Look for swaps with different user names

2. **Verify Swap Ownership:**
   - Check the swap owner name
   - Ensure you're not logged into wrong account
   - Contact support if ownership is incorrect

### Swap Unavailable

**Symptoms:**
- "Target My Swap" button disabled
- Various unavailability messages

**Common Unavailability Reasons:**

#### Proposal Pending

**Message:** "Proposal Pending - Cannot Target"

**Explanation:** One-for-one swap already has an active proposal

**Solutions:**
- Wait for current proposal to be resolved
- Set up notifications for when swap becomes available
- Look for auction mode swaps instead
- Find alternative swaps with similar criteria

**Timeline:** Most proposals are resolved within 24-48 hours

#### Auction Ended

**Message:** "Auction Ended - No New Proposals"

**Explanation:** Auction time period has expired

**Solutions:**
- Look for active auctions with time remaining
- Use "Active Auctions" filter in browse
- Set up alerts for new auction mode swaps
- Contact swap owner to see if they'll create new auction

**Prevention:** Target auctions early in their timeline

#### Swap Matched

**Message:** "Swap Already Matched"

**Explanation:** Swap owner has accepted a proposal

**Solutions:**
- Congratulate the matched users
- Look for similar available swaps
- Adjust your search criteria
- Create alerts for similar future swaps

#### Swap Cancelled

**Message:** "Swap No Longer Available"

**Explanation:** Swap owner cancelled their listing

**Solutions:**
- Remove from your watchlist
- Look for alternative swaps
- Contact owner to see if they'll relist
- Broaden your search criteria

### Circular Targeting

**Symptoms:**
- "Target My Swap" button disabled
- Message: "Cannot target - would create circular targeting"

**Explanation:**
Circular targeting occurs when targeting would create a loop:
- Direct: A targets B, B tries to target A
- Indirect: A targets B, B targets C, C tries to target A

**Solutions:**

1. **Break the Chain:**
   - Remove your current target
   - Wait for others to change their targets
   - Target a different swap outside the chain

2. **Find Alternative Targets:**
   - Look for swaps not in your targeting network
   - Use "Available for Targeting" filter
   - Consider swaps from new users

**Example Scenario:**
```
‚ùå Circular: Alice ‚Üí Bob ‚Üí Charlie ‚Üí Alice
‚úÖ Valid: Alice ‚Üí Bob ‚Üí Charlie ‚Üí David
```

### Network Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Network error during targeting"
- Targeting request times out
- Page doesn't respond after clicking target

**Immediate Solutions:**

   - Check if other websites work

2. **Retry Targeting:**
   - Wait 30 seconds
   - Try targeting again
   - System prevents duplicate targeting

3. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   ```
   Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   Safari: Cmd+Option+E
   ```

4. **Try Different Browser:**
   - Use incognito/private mode
   - Try different browser entirely
   - Disable browser extensions

**Advanced Solutions:**

1. **Check Network Settings:**
   - Disable VPN temporarily
   - Try different network (mobile data)
   - Check firewall settings

2. **Browser Troubleshooting:**
   - Update browser to latest version
   - Disable ad blockers
   - Reset browser settings

### Validation Errors

**Common Validation Messages:**

#### "Swap dates don't overlap"

**Cause:** Your swap dates don't match target swap dates

**Solution:**
- Check date compatibility before targeting
- Look for swaps with overlapping dates
- Consider flexible date swaps

#### "Guest count mismatch"

**Cause:** Significant difference in guest capacity

**Solution:**
- Target swaps with similar guest counts
- Check if swap allows flexible guest numbers
- Contact owner about guest flexibility

#### "Location restrictions"

**Cause:** Geographic or travel restrictions

**Solution:**
- Check location compatibility
- Verify travel restrictions
- Look for swaps in allowed regions

   - Refine your search criteria
   - Consider backup targets

### Target Matched

**Symptoms:**
