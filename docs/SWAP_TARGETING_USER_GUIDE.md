# Swap Targeting User Guide

## Overview

The Swap Targeting system allows you to redirect your existing swap to target other users' swaps directly, rather than creating multiple separate swaps. This ensures you maintain a single, manageable swap while being able to propose exchanges with different users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You must have an active swap to use the targeting system
- Your swap must be in "Available" status
- You cannot target your own swaps

### Basic Concept

Instead of creating a new swap for each proposal you want to make, you can:
1. Create one swap for your booking
2. Target other users' swaps to propose exchanges
3. Retarget to different swaps as needed
4. Maintain a single swap throughout the process

## Understanding Swap Modes

### One-for-One Mode
- **Default mode** for most swaps
- Only allows **one active proposal** at a time
- First-come, first-served basis
- Proposal must be resolved before new ones can be made

### Auction Mode
- Allows **multiple simultaneous proposals**
- Has a set time limit (auction period)
- Swap owner can choose from all received proposals
- No new proposals accepted after auction ends

## How to Target a Swap

### Step 1: Browse Available Swaps

1. Navigate to the **Browse Swaps** page
2. Use filters to find swaps that match your preferences:
   - Location
   - Dates
   - Number of guests
   - Swap mode (auction/one-for-one)

### Step 2: Target a Swap

1. Find a swap you're interested in
2. Look for the **"Target My Swap"** button
3. Click the button to open the targeting confirmation

### Step 3: Confirm Your Target

1. Review the swap details in the confirmation modal
2. Compare with your own swap details
3. Add an optional message to the swap owner
4. Click **"Confirm Targeting"**

### Step 4: Wait for Response

- You'll receive a notification when the swap owner responds
- Check your dashboard for proposal status updates
- The swap owner can accept, reject, or ignore your proposal

## Managing Your Targets

## Auction Mode vs One-for-One

### Targeting One-for-One Swaps

‚úÖ **You Can:**
- Target if no pending proposals exist
- See immediate feedback on targeting success

‚ùå **You Cannot:**

- Target after the swap is matched

**Visual Indicators:**
- üü¢ Green "Target My Swap" button = Available
- üî¥ Red "Proposal Pending" message = Unavailable
- üîí "Matched" badge = No longer available

### Targeting Auction Mode Swaps

‚úÖ **You Can:**
- Target even if other proposals exist
- Compete with other users for the swap
- Target until the auction ends

‚ùå **You Cannot:**
- Target after auction time expires
- Modify your proposal once submitted

**Visual Indicators:**
- ‚è∞ Countdown timer showing time remaining
- üìä Number of current proposals
- üèÅ "Auction Ended" when time expires

### Auction Timeline Example

```
Day 1: Auction starts (24-hour duration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Hour 1: You target the swap (Proposal #1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Hour 8: Another user targets (Proposal #2)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Hour 16: Third user targets (Proposal #3)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Day 2: Auction ends, owner chooses winner
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Cannot Target - Proposal Pending"

**Problem:** The swap already has a pending proposal (one-for-one mode)

**Solution:**
- Wait for the current proposal to be resolved
- Look for auction mode swaps instead
- Set up notifications for when the swap becomes available

#### "Auction Ended - Cannot Target"

**Problem:** The auction period has expired

**Solution:**
- Look for active auctions with time remaining
- Use auction filters to find currently active auctions
- Set up alerts for new auction mode swaps

#### "Target Swap No Longer Available"

**Problem:** The swap you were targeting was cancelled or matched

**Solution:**
- Your swap automatically returns to general availability
- Browse for new targets
- Check your targeting history for details

#### "Network Error During Targeting"

**Problem:** Connection issues during targeting process

**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Try targeting again (the system prevents duplicates)
- Contact support if the issue persists

#### "Cannot Target Own Swap"

**Problem:** Trying to target your own swap

**Solution:**
- You cannot target swaps you own
- Look for swaps from other users
- Consider if you need to create a different swap
