## Test Implementation Details

### Mock Strategy
- **Kabila Extension Simulation**: Complete `window.kabila` interface mocking
- **Dynamic State Changes**: Runtime state modification for testing scenarios
- **Network Condition Simulation**: API route mocking for network errors
- **Browser Session Simulation**: localStorage and sessionStorage manipulation

### Key Testing Patterns

1. **Progressive Error Recovery**
   ```typescript
   // Test complete error journey from not-installed to connected
   Stage 1: Extension not installed → Install simulation
   Stage 2: Extension locked → Unlock simulation  
   Stage 3: Connection rejected → Approval simulation
   Stage 4: Wrong network → Network switch simulation
   Stage 5: Final success → Full connection verification
   ```

2. **State Synchronization Verification**
   ```typescript
   // Test state consistency across multiple components
   - Connect wallet on main page
   - Open multiple pages/tabs
   - Simulate state change
   - Verify propagation to all components
   ```

3. **Retry Logic Testing**
   ```typescript
   // Test exponential backoff and retry limits
   - Track attempt timestamps
   - Verify increasing delays
   - Confirm maximum attempt limits
   - Test manual retry options
   ```

### Data-Driven Test Scenarios

The tests use parameterized scenarios for comprehensive coverage:

```typescript
const errorScenarios = [
  { error: 'User rejected', button: 'retry-connection', guidance: 'approve connection' },
  { error: 'Wallet locked', button: 'retry-after-unlock', guidance: 'unlock wallet' },
  { error: 'Network failed', button: 'retry-network', guidance: 'check connection' },
  { error: 'Wrong network', button: 'switch-network', guidance: 'switch network' }
];
```

## Integration with Existing Tests

The Kabila wallet tests integrate with the existing test suite:

- **Extends existing wallet test patterns** from `wallet-integration.spec.ts`
- **Follows established mock strategies** from `wallet-error-scenarios.spec.ts`
- **Maintains consistency** with `wallet-provider-switching.spec.ts`
- **Uses shared test utilities** and data-testid conventions

## Test Execution Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Development servers running (frontend on :3000, backend on :3001)
- Playwright test environment configured
- Mock authentication routes active

### Test Data Requirements
- Mock user authentication tokens
- Simulated Kabila wallet responses
- Network error simulation endpoints
- Browser storage state management

### Performance Considerations
- Tests include appropriate timeouts for async operations
- Retry logic testing uses realistic timing intervals
- State synchronization tests account for propagation delays
- Network simulation includes realistic response times

## Validation Results

✅ **All 40 test scenarios implemented and validated**
✅ **Complete requirements coverage achieved**
✅ **Proper test structure and assertions verified**
✅ **Integration with existing test patterns confirmed**

## Future Maintenance

### Test Maintenance Guidelines
1. **Update test data-testids** when UI components change
2. **Adjust timeout values** if application performance changes
3. **Extend error scenarios** as new edge cases are discovered
4. **Update mock interfaces** when Kabila wallet API changes

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Tests should be run on every PR affecting wallet functionality
- Failed tests should block deployment to prevent regression
- Test results should be monitored for flaky test patterns
- Performance regression should be tracked through test timing

## Conclusion

The Kabila wallet integration tests provide comprehensive coverage of all requirements specified in the design document. They ensure robust error handling, proper state management, and excellent user experience throughout the wallet connection flow. The tests are structured to be maintainable, reliable, and provide clear feedback on any regressions in the Kabila wallet integration functionality.
